# Sir Ajantis for BG2
Sir Ajantis NPC for BGII modification introduces Ajantis, the known BG1 NPC, paladin of the Order of the Radiant Heart into the SoA and ToB part of the game. 

With this modification Ajantis can be acquired as a member of the PC's group after the fight in the Windspear Hills (which was not changed by the mod principally). The player must then solve a quest to free Ajantis from Firkraag's ransom. 
The modification contains a fully developed engaged romance path, which continues the Ajantis Romance from the [BG1 NPC Project](https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/npcs/bg1npc/) (for vanilla BG1: [BG1 Ajantis Expansion Mod](https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/npcs/ajantis/); a new beginnings romance, and a friendship path.

Contentwise, the mod assumes that Ajantis travelled with the PC in BG1 for some time. It was there that Ajantis gained enough honor to be knighted.

EET, BGT: in a continuous game Ajantis will not spawn in BGII if he never joined the goup.

ToB: Ajantis will not travel with an evil aligned PC in ToB.

For the EE games (BGII:EE and EET) the second optional component will install the BeamDog inventory BAM for Ajantis' family shield (green dragon on golden ground). If not installed, the BG1NPC Project shield graphic will be used.

From v19, the crossmod component is no longer part of tis mod, but moved into the Crossmod Banter Pack.

The now third optional component gives the choice to install the mature romance content (not teen rated). Please note that deinstalling this component midgame will not revert the mature romance level. Do not install this component if you want the romance to be teen rated.

The 4th optional component gives the possibility to chose a different time between lovetalks in SoA. The standard of 1h between lovetalk is the default value and already installed by the main component. Only chose one of the install components if you want to have a different timer than 1h between lovetalks. To revert back to 1h, just uninstall this component.

THe 5th component gives the possibility to make Ajantis Cavalier. Please note that this takes only effect before Ajantis was met the first time in the agem, and also, that deinstalling this component midgame (after meeting Ajantis) will not revert his class back to plain Paladin.
