@194  = ~Of course. It was just a question.~

@200  = ~Let us... end this conversation. I do not know what you object to.~ 
@201  = ~What do you mean by this? I would never...~
@202  = ~That is easily told. The tensions at the Sword Coast and the threatening war with Amn required many missions by the Order. I returned to the headquarters of the Order, was found worthy of knighthood, and was belted to the title of knight.~

@215  = ~Yes, very much. I do not understand it yet. Forgive me, but I need some more time.~

@238  = ~My choice is fast and simple. A colorless star sapphire traditionally adorns the finger of a bride, and such a stone I would choose for your ring.

@245  = ~Your wish is my command, Sir Knight. I will immediately go to my alternate forge.

@252  = ~I am pleased. I will quickly send the bag back, with a message bearing our decision, to Master Surianko. He assured me that he could forge the rings as soon as he knows our preference. I am afraid it will nevertheless take a few days before they are finished.~

@269  = ~(You take a look at your ring...)~
@270  = ~Tell me something about Helm or the Order, Ajantis.~
@271  = ~To do *what*? Honestly, love, I don't like what kind of game you are making out of this.~
@272  = ~No.~
@273  = ~(sigh)~
@274  = ~(Ajantis makes no secret of his unease.) Love... Veldrin, what can I do for you?~
@275  = ~Give me a kiss!~
@276  = ~Give me a hug!~
@277  = ~Smile for me, male!~
@278  = ~Clean my boots!~
@279  = ~You behaved well, male. Come here and get your reward!~
@280  = ~Come here, male, I have to punish you!~
@281  = ~Get me a drink!~
@282  = ~(You wrap your arms around his shoulders and whisper in his ear.) I want you to prepare for tonight, male, as I will need your service!~
@283  = ~Nothing, I got it.~
@284  = ~(Ajantis gives you a sad smile.) I long for this nightmare to be over, love.~
@285  = ~This is an order I am usually glad to fulfill, love... but not here.~
@286  = ~I will do so on our next rest, if this is your wish.~
@287  = ~Don't you think you are overdoing this a bit?~
@288  = ~I am sure this is a joke, albeit a bad one, love.~
@289  = ~Although we are... drow, I don't like the tone you are using... Veldrin.~
@290  = ~Don't you think I got punished enough?~
@291  = ~I beg your pardon?~
@292  = ~I... I'd rather we don't, love. Not here, not... like this.~
@293  = ~Thoughts of what you suggest are forming in my head, love... But all I see is a drow. Forgive me.~
@294  = ~I will do whatever you need, love, but do not expect me to give up on my vigilance in this evil place.~
@295  = ~(Ajantis is near you now.)~
@296  = ~Love, I thank you for this pleasant touch, but don't you think you are overdoing this a bit?...~
@297  = ~(sigh) I wish we could leave this evil place... and be our former selves again.~
@298  = ~Love, I yearn for you more than you can imagine. Let us finish what we came for so we can return home.~
@299  = ~I prefer you the way I know you, love... Please forgive me for saying so.~
@300  = ~I love you in whatever state you are in... I think.~
@301  = ~I still recognize you, love, and that is important to me.~
@302  = ~(You still recognize Ajantis, but his appearance is that of a drow.)~
@303  = ~(Ajantis notices your attention and gives you a wary smile.) I cannot help but feel watched. I am not surprised, considering my drow appearance.~
@304  = ~(Ajantis notices your attention and turns to you.) I hope you can still remember what I truly look like, love.~
@305  = ~(Ajantis doesn't seem to notice your attention, leaving you a quiet moment for examination of his unusual appearance.)~
@306  = ~Yes, love... Just thinking about our plans for the day, in this evil place.~
@307  = ~Do you mean the one you have, or the one you have *now*?~
@308  = ~Please, not now...  (whispers) Keep in mind where we are!~
@309  = ~And I for yours... your real one, love, not this unwanted state we are in now.~
@310  = ~I hope they don't get suspicious if they see the ring... But what am I talking about, surely they have surface rings here as well.~
@311  = ~Thank you for asking, my love. I am at unease in this evil place... Let us do our duty quickly so we can leave.~
@312  = ~Thank you for asking, my love. I dread this place and... suffer from the discomfort of a certain drow garment.~
@313  = ~(whispers) I'd rather not, love. Let us talk about it once we are safe again.~
@314  = ~As I do you... But we should be careful with statements like these in this place of hate and evil!~
@315  = ~What can I do for you, my love?~ [c#ablank]
@316  = ~Would you do something for me?~
@317  = ~I am so happy we are reunited, safe and sound.~
@318  = ~It's good fighting at your side again, my paladin.~
@319  = ~Why do you love me?~
@320  = ~What is your favorite memory of the time we've spent together?~
@321  = ~What do you want to do when our quest is over?~
@322  = ~It is good to see you still dream of something better.. something more than the things that surround us.~
@323  = ~Love, do not weaken our vigilance with these kinds of games. Not here.~
@324  = ~As I do for yours, love. There *will* be time for that again.~
@325  = ~And fighting we will, so that we may leave this dreadful place in victory.~
@326  = ~As am I, although this place scares me tremendously, love.~
@327  = ~Thank you, love, but you know I take my responsibilities very seriously. Especially in this evil place.~
@328  = ~I could do no less, protecting you, both from threats from without and within!~
@329  = ~And protect you, I shall, against all foes, with all my might, against whatever will stand against us.~
@330  = ~Your distraction is delightful, but I must ask you to stop until we are safe again.~
@331  = ~Please, love! We must remain alert and on guard! Especially in this evil place.~
@332  = ~Dearest <CHARNAME>, I must ask you not to do that until we are safe again.~
@333  = ~I thank you for this kiss, but I must ask you not to do this again until we have escaped this evil place.~
@334  = ~What would you like me to do?~
@335  = ~Give me a kiss.~
@336  = ~Give me a hug, Ajantis.~
@337  = ~Keep an eye on Edwin for a while. He's been muttering more than usual.~
@338  = ~When we stop for our next break, will you see to our gear? I will be really tired.~
@339  = ~(whisper in his ear) Will you see to it that I won't be cold tonight, Ajantis?~
@340  = ~Never mind, I got it.~
@341  = ~What, here? There will be time for this again, once we manage to leave this place.~
@342  = ~Do you think this wise, here? (Ajantis kisses you hastily.) Let us do this in a place with more safety, love.~
@343  = ~I will do that. You see to your rest. I can imagine you grow tired in this dreadful place.~
@344  = ~Of course, my love. I learned a lot of things during my times as squire. I will heat a stone for you in the fire. Wrapped inside a cloth it keeps nice and warm during the night.~
@345  = ~Sometimes, a pouch filled with hot water does the trick, too. You only have to watch it doesn't leak. This is what I can think of, if you ask me... to...~
@346  = ~(with reddening ears) And finally, I get what you were actually saying. (ahem) Oh, my love, how much I would love to do that... And with great pleasure I would. But not in these circumstances. Let us remain vigilant, to be prepared for our enemy.~
@347  = ~I will warm you in every way that is needed to keep you warm, love, but I will not give up on my vigilance in this dreadful place.~
@348  = ~I am sorry, beloved, but please, do not reduce my vigilance by touching me in this evil place.~
@349  = ~Later, beloved. I do not feel comfortable in this evil place.~
@350  = ~If you wish, love...  (Ajantis hugs you hastily). This should wait until we are in a safer place.~
@351  = ~I grow weary, love. In this place, where there is no difference between day and night, we should look for a resting place to gather our strength.~
@352  = ~I am happy to be at your side, but I loathe this place. Let us be vigilant until we find our way out of this nightmare.~
@353  = ~What do you think of my tunic?~
@354  = ~Imagine me coming out of the bathing room. Half wet, I hold the towel that wraps around my body with one hand, approaching you...~
@355  = ~Wait a minute, my husband... (You dust off his cloak with some strokes of your hand.) Here you go, much better.~
@356  = ~Ajantis, did you put only that thin cloth as padding under your helmet again? I don't think that's enough.~
@357  = ~(Ajantis is walking behind you. You feel like teasing him a bit.)~
@358  = ~(You let a small object fall to the ground.)~
@359  = ~My love, you... Wait! I remember this game from the Sword Coast, <CHARNAME>. You are doing this on purpose!~
@360  = ~(sigh) Here you are, love.~
@361  = ~Here you are. My love, I know this is a game, but I would never let you lose something!~
@362  = ~(Ajantis raises his glance, and you know what he was looking at before. Blushing a bright red, he gives you a shy smile before turning away.)~
@363  = ~(Ajantis gives you a quick look.) Someone is trying to distract me, it seems.~
@364  = ~You have radiant hair, my love.~
@365  = ~Your hair shines so beautifully when you do that, my love.~
@366  = ~Is something wrong, my love? Are we going too fast?~
@367  = ~This is a game, isn't it? Do I have to shove you, love?~
@368  = ~(Ajantis comes to a sudden halt in front of you, your bodies nearly touching). Oh, I am sorry, my love.~
@369  = ~(Ajantis manages to prevent a collision, but now you are standing face to face, Ajantis holding you in his arms.) What was that?~
@370  = ~(You give him a quick kiss.)~
@371  = ~Everything is all right, Ajantis.~
@372  = ~(Ajantis bumps into you, giving a faint sound.) I am terribly sorry, my love. Are you all right?~
@373  = ~(Ajantis catches you in his arms.) <CHARNAME>! Is everything all right?~
@374  = ~(You fold your arms around his neck and give him a kiss.)~
@375  = ~(Ajantis catches you, nearly falling himself.) Watch your step, my love. I hope everything is all right?~
@376  = ~(Surprised, Ajantis kisses you back before letting you go.) That was... conniving! (smile)~
@377  = ~I guess it is! This time, it's my turn! (He kisses you.)~
@378  = ~But let us stop this game now, love. It is very distracting!~
@379  = ~(Ajantis makes a jump to catch you, nearly toppling himself.) Ouch... Here you go, my love.~
@380  = ~(Ajantis catches you in his arms.) <CHARNAME>! Please stop this game.~
@381  = ~(Ajantis catches you, nearly falling himself.) Stop it, please!~
@382  = ~As I do for yours... And now I have to get that thought out of my head again, if I want to sustain my vigilance!~
@383  = ~There will be time for that, my love.~
@384  = ~As I do for yours.~
@385  = ~And I will make it worth the wait, my love.~
@386  = ~And I for yours... As soon as we manage to get rid of this... thing.~
@387  = ~(smile) It takes time to get used to it, doesn't it?~
@388  = ~Your ring is beautiful. I hope you like it?~
@389  = ~Your fingers look even prettier if adorned with such a ring. But even without one, your hands are the most beautiful, my love.~
@390  = ~(sigh) I hoped you would carry it proudly in the name of the Ilvastarr family...~
@391  = ~No, no more of that. I am sorry I let my thoughts go astray.~
@392  = ~(Ajantis whispers the right color into your ear.) And they are ever beautiful, my love.~
@393  = ~(Ajantis whispers the right color into your ear.) How could I not know this, as these eyes are the mirror of my soul.~
@394  = ~They are... (cough) Please love, I was distracted. Of course I know the color of your eyes, beautiful woman.~
@395  = ~It's good to see you don't have only nightmares. At least I hope it wasn't a nightmare?~
@396  = ~(smile) It was a sweet dream, I hope. I love you, <CHARNAME>.~
@397  = ~What a coincidence, as I was dreaming about you.~
@398  = ~(Ajantis gives your fingers a reassuring squeeze, but releases them immediately.)~
@399  = ~Sorry, love. I must remain vigilant.~
@400  = ~Your distraction is delightful, but I must ask you to stop until we are alone.~
@401  = ~Please, love, do not tempt me to be lax in my duty.~
@402  = ~(Ajantis kisses your hand, but lets it go immediately.)~
@403  = ~Not now, love.~
@404  = ~Please, love! We must remain alert and on guard!~
@405  = ~But thank you. You know I enjoyed it. (smiles)~
@406  = ~Can I have another one of those later, when we are in a place of safety?~
@407  = ~(Ajantis raises his hand at your approach.) Later, beloved.~
@408  = ~Please don't do that, my love. You know how your closeness distracts me.~
@409  = ~Dearest <CHARNAME>, I must ask you not to do that until we are alone.~
@410  = ~Beloved, your kiss is bewitching, but dangerous. Who knows what evil might befall us while I am so distracted?~
@411  = ~(Ajantis catches you before you are close enough to kiss him.)~
@412  = ~Later, love, and I will make you glad you waited!~
@413  = ~(For the briefest moment, Ajantis allows your kiss, then gently disengages your hands.)~
@414  = ~There will be more kisses later, but we must remain vigilant.~
@415  = ~Careful, love, I would think you a thief, stealing kisses like that!~
@416  = ~Love, I hate to refuse such a wonderful gift, but I must. Please don't distract me now.~
@417  = ~Thank you.~
@418  = ~(Ajantis returns your kiss distractedly, moving his head as if he were trying to look over your shoulder while kissing you.)~
@419  = ~Yes, love. Just thinking about our plans for the day.~
@420  = ~Now that you mention it, love, there are some things you have done that have raised some doubts about your dedication to goodness. I would appreciate it if you would give more thought to your behavior, while there is still time to make amends.~
@421  = ~Lady <CHARNAME>, there are times I have trouble believing that you really *are* devoted to the path of goodness. These doubts are driving a wedge between us. Please, for the sake of our future marriage, have more care with your actions.~
@422  = ~That is a sentiment I echo. I am glad we are reunited.~
@423  = ~I am glad to be in your company once more, but I hope you will take better note of my example. Some of your deeds are not as good as I would like.~
@424  = ~If you truly feel that way, I am surprised your own behavior so often falls short of goodness. Please, love, let me steer you to better choices.~
@425  = ~And I love you!~
@426  = ~I never get tired of hearing you say that.~
@427  = ~I treasure your love always.~
@428  = ~I am glad, for I love you, too!~
@429  = ~Your love is a gift I will always cherish.~
@430  = ~As I love you!~
@431  = ~And I love you, but sometimes you make it difficult.~
@432  = ~Because you are the most amazing woman I have ever met.~
@433  = ~I love you because of your inner strength.~
@434  = ~I love you because we share a dream.~
@435  = ~The reasons are too numerous to name.~
@436  = ~I love you because you have a beautiful soul.~
@437  = ~Because I thought we were united in the cause of goodness and righteousness. Sometimes, I doubt the latter, though.~
@438  = ~Thank you, love, but you know I take my responsibilities very seriously.~
@439  = ~I could do no less.~
@440  = ~Thank you, love, but I am just doing my duty.~
@441  = ~And protect you I shall, against all foes.~
@442  = ~I want to dance with you, Ajantis.~
@443  = ~(With reddening ears) And finally, I get what you were actually saying. (ahem) Yes, my love, I will see to it that you won't be cold tonight... And with great pleasure. Be assured of that.~
@444  = ~Dancing? Well... It seems to be safe here. Did we ever do this at all, my love?~
@445  = ~I can't remember. I don't think we had time for this at the Sword Coast.~
@446  = ~No, we didn't.~
@447  = ~Never mind, maybe it wasn't such a good idea.~
@448  = ~Yes, I thought so, too. But what a wonderful idea. Let us spare this moment, <CHARNAME>, and pretend we are the only persons in this establishment. Listen, they play acceptable music. Do you know how to dance to this tune?~
@449  = ~Yes, I do.~
@450  = ~No, please show me.~
@451  = ~Let us put down our heavy equipment. May I take your hand, beautiful lady...~
@452  = ~What a pleasure to dance with you, love!~
@453  = ~I hope we can do this again sometime. It was wonderful. But, for now, I would be glad no one is staring.~
@454  = ~It is safe here, so I am happy to fulfill your wish. Let me take your hand...~
@455  = ~You know I enjoy dancing with you, <CHARNAME>. Still, we should not indulge in such things too often. Let us do it another time.~
@456  = ~I'd rather we did not. This place is safe, but we have urgent things to do.~
@457  = ~Not here, my love. I feel evil lurking nearby.~
@458  = ~Not here, my love. Ask me in one of the known inns we pass. We might be able to indulge in a rare luxury like this in a place like that.~
@459  = ~As soon as I am free in my... motions again, love, we can think about this. But right now making me dance would be a cruel thing to do.~
@460  = ~If that is an order, I have to obey. (smile)~
@461  = ~This is an order that I long to fulfill, my love. (Ajantis kisses you tenderly.)~
@462  = ~Do you think this wise, here? (Ajantis kisses you hastily.) Let us do this in a place with more privacy, love.~
@463  = ~(Ajantis takes you in his arms for a short, but reassuring hug.) This is an order that I long to fulfill, my love.~
@464  = ~Do you think this wise, here? Let us do this in a place with more privacy, love.~
@465  = ~I always do.~
@466  = ~Certainly, love.~
@467  = ~With pleasure! But... don't distract me with these thoughts just now, my love.~
@468  = ~Very well. Let me know if you need anything else.~
@469  = ~Everything looks good on you.~
@470  = ~That there is the best-looking woman inside.~
@471  = ~I like it, and it looks good on you.~
@472  = ~The day you agreed to marry me.~
@473  = ~The day I first saw your face.~
@474  = ~The first time I held you in my arms.~
@475  = ~There are so many good memories, all vying for preference. It is impossible to choose.~
@476  = ~Settle down, as much as my Oath to the Order will allow, and raise a family with my lovely wife.~
@477  = ~Helm will show me the way when the time comes.~
@478  = ~Spend some time alone with the woman I love.~
@479  = ~I would like to take you to visit my family.~
@480  = ~Let me take you to Waterdeep, so that I may show you all the things I have spoken of so many times.~
@481  = ~You and I will both do what our gods and the fates demand.~
@482  = ~(As usual, Ajantis' face wears a stern expression of concentration, vigilance, and loyalty. The frown between his brows seems to have vanished, though.)~
@483  = ~(The outline of Ajantis' armor and clothing provides a suggestion of muscular shoulders and arms. They are not bulky, yet they display strength gained by years of hard training.)~
@484  = ~(Ajantis' armor and clothes are in good condition, proving his effort in taking care of them. On his cloak, the Ilvastarr family coat of arms is shown: a metallic green dragon with orange eyes on a gold background. Ajantis is standing upright, his expression radiating vigilance and loyalty. The hint of nervousness you noticed earlier seems to be gone.)~
@485  = ~(Ajantis notices your attention and gives you a smile.) I cannot help but feel watched, my love.~
@486  = ~(Ajantis notices your attention and turns to you.) Is something wrong, my love?~
@487  = ~I would appreciate healing for my wounds, my love.~
@488  = ~I am exhausted... We should take a small rest to gather our strength, my love.~
@489  = ~I am tired. We should take the time to rest, or evil will find us unprepared, my love.~
@490  = ~I am tired, my love. It has been a long day, and we are exhausted. Let us take a rest and prepare for the next day.~
@491  = ~I am tired, and it is a dark night. We should take the time to rest. I can't stand the thought that evil might find us unprepared, my love.~
@492  = ~Thank you for asking, my love. I am happy, for I am at your side.~
@493  = ~As ever, ready to fight any evil that we might encounter, my love, to protect you.~
@494  = ~Thank you for asking, my love. I am fine and I hope you are, as well.~
@495  = ~Thank you for asking, my love. I am fine, except for the... discomfort of a certain drow garment.~
@496  = ~This is what wives do for their husbands... I guess. Thank you.~
@497  = ~We will be marching through dusty roads again any time, <CHARNAME>... But, thank you.~
@498  = ~Are you trying to tell me I don't care enough for my appearance? I... Well, thank you.~
@499  = ~That is how I did it the last 15 years... Oh well.~
@500  = ~(sigh) Here she is, my wife speaking.~
@501  = ~It is not only a thin cloth. It is sufficient, I assure you!~
@502  = ~Yes, I feel the same, love.~
@503  = ~I know what you mean. The time between was a pure nightmare we hopefully left behind.~
@504  = ~And I am happy to have you near me, too.~
@505  = ~My eyes are locked with yours, I take both your hands and pull you near, letting the towel drop to the floor... And I don't know what happens next. (coughs) Love, I'll need a lot of marching in fresh air to get rid of that thought.~
@506  = ~I have no idea what I would probably do... (Ajantis kisses you.) Let us try that out sometime, my love.~
@507  = ~<CHARNAME>, don't put such thoughts into my head... I need my vigilance elsewhere. (ahem)~
@508  = ~'Love, dry yourself. You'll get a cold.' Well, there *is* a chance I would say that...~
@509  = ~You are cruel, giving me thoughts like these in the state I am in... Let us hope I can get rid of this cursed belt soon, and then ask me again, love.~
@510  = ~What do you want to know?~
@511  = ~Now we are married at last, Ajantis! I am very happy.~
@512  = ~It's a pity your family wants to have the family shield back, but somehow it was to be expected.~
@513  = ~Ajantis, I cannot allow your family shield to be given away once we retrieve it. It's not that bad a shield, and we need it for our fight!~
@514  = ~We are having a nice, quiet moment, Ajantis. I would like to plan our wedding now.~
@515  = ~Ajantis, the wedding rings of Master Surianko are really beautiful.~
@516  = ~Ajantis, I wouldn't say the selection from Master Surianko is very inspiring.~

@521  = ~You mentioned the possibility of having pattern rings sent to us...~
@522  = ~What about the sample bag of wedding rings that you wanted to have sent?~
@523  = ~The pendant is pretty, Ajantis. I like the picture of you on it. Thank you!~
@524  = ~The pendant is cheap, Ajantis, and I did not want to have it.~
@525  = ~The gem bag is really beautiful, Ajantis. A very noble gift. Thank you!~
@526  = ~Forgive my derogatory words lately, Ajantis. The gem bag is really beautiful, a very precious gift. Thank you!~
@527  = ~Thank you for the gem bag, Ajantis, but a... less practical gift would have pleased me more, I think.~
@528  = ~Look at what Irenicus's thugs have done to my engagement ring!~

@531  = ~Ajantis, look! Here are the fragments of the engagement ring.~
@532  = ~Ajantis, I changed my mind. I would like you to take the fragments of the engagement ring in order to forge them into a new ring.~
@533  = ~Whether we have the fragments of the engagement ring or not, I would not like you to use them for the new ring, Ajantis.~
@534  = ~Ajantis, I have now decided which color of gemstone the new engagement ring should have.~

@551  = ~I don't believe you. Maybe you don't want to talk about it, but I am sure it bothers you quite a bit.~

@553  = ~It's great you see it that way. I can't stand the topic any more anyway.~
@554  = ~If you ever see me doing that, I'll ask you to slap my face very hard. It is not your fault, love, and you know that. *I* know it for sure.~
@555  = ~It is something that... just happened. The gods lead us onto paths we sometimes don't understand. I had to make a decision, and a cruel one it was. I lost, and I gained. I gained more than I lost, <CHARNAME>, my love.~
@556  = ~That I would have liked to have both is not important if we talk about destiny. Of course it bothers me, but I know it will turn into good. It already turned out good, because you are here at my side.~
@557  = ~Well... Yes, you are right.~
@558  = ~But if it is your wish not to talk about it, I shall respect it.~
@559  = ~Can't you understand that I feel guilty about it? Somehow, it is my fault. I couldn't resent you if you feel the same and blame me in secret.~
@560  = ~(sigh) I can't stand the topic any more, Ajantis.~
@561  = ~This won't happen any more concerning *that* topic, love.~
@562  = ~What did you dream of?~
@563  = ~Ellesime, and she showed me the cruel things that Irenicus is doing with my power. I must go and face him.~
@564  = ~I have to stop Irenicus before he causes more mischief with my soul!~
@565  = ~It is no longer so important, but I thank you for being here for me.~
@566  = ~Then let us go and defeat this monster. He has spread terror with your soul for long enough.~
@567  = ~Whatever terrible things you saw, I will use all my skill, and with Helm's assistance, I will endeavor to prevent them from happening.~
@568  = ~Really? It would not be the first time that your dreams have been meaningful, beloved. Can you sense the whole situation?~
@569  = ~Well, everything will be clarified if I defeat Irenicus, I guess.~
@570  = ~All of this frightens me, Ajantis...~
@571  = ~No, none, but it doesn't matter.~
@572  = ~Then let us finish this villain as soon as possible, <CHARNAME>. He has already taken far too much from you.~
@573  = ~I believe you. Despair not, because I am with you. Continuing with your search is certainly the right approach, whether your dreams have a meaning or not.~
@574  = ~Well, to continue with your search is certainly the right approach, whether your dreams have a meaning or not.~
@575  = ~<CHARNAME>, beloved! My heart beats loudly with joy. I longed for this day from the moment I made the decision to ask you for your hand. I would like to hold and kiss you!~
@576  = ~(You take Ajantis in you arms.) I love you!~
@577  = ~Yes, it is a beautiful moment. (You give Ajantis a kiss.)~
@578  = ~We have important work at the moment, I think.~
@579  = ~You are probably right. We will still have enough opportunities to enjoy our time together. I am thankful that we nevertheless took the time to celebrate our wedding.~
@580  = ~No, this moment I cannot let pass! (Ajantis takes you into his arms and hugs you close for a moment.)~
@581  = ~I am happy to know you now as my wife. Let us stand against the evil of this world together! I swore an oath of loyalty to you, and I say it again: I will be with you and will protect you. We will walk together on the path of righteousness.~
@582  = ~Oh, my friends. My old eyes are actually wet. I wish you all the best for the path you share.~
@583  = ~I wish you all the best, comrades.~
@584  = ~Minsc is happy for his friends. We are so moved that we do not know what we should say, right, Boo?~
@585  = ~Minsc is happy for his friends. Boo would know what to say now. If only Boo were here!~
@586  = ~What-what a joyful moment!~
@587  = ~You have sworn a serious oath and gained a lot of responsibility. May the balance never leave you.~
@588  = ~Tin suit, dry the tears from your eyes. It could be that you do not see my axe coming.~
@589  = ~Amazing what your devotion to this relationship contrives. (Although I am rather surprised that this monkey is even capable of understanding the meaning of such a relationship.)~
@590  = ~Let us leave here. The halls of the ever watchful one are too overwhelming for me. If we are far enough away, perhaps I will honor you and compose an ode.~
@591  = ~Voluntarily celebrating a wedding is a very good thing. I hope you will find your peace.~
@592  = ~I wish that your enemies leave you in peace.~
@593  = ~What strange ritual of self obligation. One man for a woman, what a meager allocation.~
@594  = ~I never thought that I would be present at the wedding of an Order knight...~
@595  = ~Proud and noble you look, Sir Ajantis. I wish you as well, <CHARNAME>, all the best for your marriage.~
@596  = ~An oath before a god reminds us that there are more important commitments than our own. May you never be denied assistance.~
@597  = ~Oh, this reminds me of Aunt Fidelia's wedding. Their third, to be precise. The two earlier were not quite so moving, nor the five thereafter. But their seventh wedding involved a certain amount of comedy, as the former husband of the married aunt Franni, who a year later, married the niece of Uncle Frenkel, or was it his daughter? That is what I was reminded of.~
@598  = ~Now you are married. <CHARNAME>, I wish you all the best. Sir Ajantis, see that you take good care of her!~
@599  = ~Ajantis, I am happy you are now my husband. I will support and protect you, as I swore.~
@600  = ~What you said was beautiful, Ajantis. Thank you.~
@601  = ~Hmm. Let us continue, we have much to do.~
@602  = ~And I love you, <CHARNAME>, from the bottom of my heart. (Ajantis embraces you and gives you a gentle kiss.)~
@603  = ~(Ajantis answers your kiss with passion.) A very beautiful moment!~
@604  = ~That we have, indeed.~
@605  = ~Your words please me, beloved.~
@606  = ~I had hoped that the use of fine velvet and embroidery would weaken the fact somewhat, beloved. But you are right, it is a primarily practical gift.~
@607  = ~I sent it back, since I did not know how long we would be separated.~ 
@608  = ~I sent it back before we came here, since I did not know how long we would be gone.~
@609  = ~I am happy to hear that. He is a widely known, excellent goldsmith, <CHARNAME>.~
@610  = ~I already selected one of the wedding rings from master Surianko. Shall I tell you my choice?~
@611  = ~I assume we will look at the rings again, if the time has come.~
@612  = ~Very gladly, if you wish it. Which pleased you the best?~
@613  = ~I would like the ornate ring, adorned with a star sapphire.~
@614  = ~I would like the ornate ring, adorned with an emerald.~
@615  = ~I would like the ornate ring, adorned with an opal.~
@616  = ~I would like the ornate ring, adorned with a ruby.~
@617  = ~I would like the ornate ring, adorned with a sunstone.~
@618  = ~I would like the ornate, stoneless ring.~
@619  = ~I would like the plain ring, adorned with a star sapphire.~
@620  = ~I would like the plain ring, adorned with an emerald.~
@621  = ~I would like the plain ring, adorned by an opal.~
@622  = ~I would like the plain ring, adorned by a ruby.~
@623  = ~I would like the plain ring, adorned with a sunstone.~
@624  = ~I would like the plain, stoneless ring.~
@625  = ~No, I would not like to decide now after all. I assume we can look at the rings again, when the time comes.~
@626  = ~A fine choice, beloved.~
@627  = ~That is how we will do it.~
@628  = ~It saddens me to hear that, beloved. He is the only goldsmith I know in Athkatla, and... well, I like his selection rather well.~ 


@629  = ~Yes, let us speak about it now. How very much I look forward to the moment!~

@635  = ~Well... Since I am out of sorts with my own church, there is probably no other choice.~
@636  = ~I thank you. Let me contact the temple of Helm in Athkatla.~
@637  = ~I do, but I hope you will like the ceremony. Let me contact the temple of Helm in Athkatla.~
@638  = ~Well, for me no priest of another divinity is applicable. Can you accept that idea?~
@639  = ~(smile) Of course.~
@640  = ~Since I know your stubbornness, I know that I have no other choice.~
@641  = ~This I know. Your faith does not prevent you from being married by a priest of another god.~
@642  = ~That is true. I therefore agree.~
@643  = ~I thank you and hope you will like the ceremony. Let me contact the temple of Helm in Athkatla.~
@644  = ~Am I correct in the assumption that you would like to choose your wedding ring, beloved?~
@645  = ~My suggestion is clear. Master Goldsmith Surianko in Waukeen's Promenade forges the most artistic wedding rings. In addition, aside from some rare occasions, he is the only goldsmith I have found in Athkatla who does not sell junk.~
@646  = ~Fortunately he now offers his jewelry in the Mithrest Inn, since his forge was destroyed.~
@647  = ~You mean we should ask him about wedding rings?~
@648  = ~Is there no other possibility?~
@649  = ~There is a very nice shop... (blushes) I speak of master goldsmith Surianko's smithy, <CHARNAME>. I was once in his shop and asked myself if there would be anything to your taste...~
@650  = ~It was in Waukeen's Promenade, but the forge was probably destroyed in the collapse. I was very pleased to hear that master Surianko survived the explosion and now sells his excellent jewelry in the Mithrest Inn.~
@651  = ~You have been looking at jewelry for me? That is so sweet of you, Ajantis!~
@652  = ~Yes, I have already met him there.~
@653  = ~You suggest that we should choose the wedding rings there, then?~
@654  = ~Indeed! Then you already know of him. I would not be surprised if you did not see any wedding rings while you were there. You likely must ask directly to see them.~
@655  = ~You have already selected one from master Surianko. Does it remain your choice?~
@656  = ~Yes, it does.~
@657  = ~Actually, I would like to see the rings again.~
@658  = ~No. I think master Surianko's rings are not nice enough. Is there no other way?~
@659  = ~I will give our answer to master Surianko as soon as possible then. We will receive a message when the rings are forged and everything else is prepared. I will let you know as soon as we do.~
@660  = ~I suggest that we peruse master Surianko's selection and choose a ring that suits your taste, love.~
@661  = ~Well, so it shall be. We will go as soon as possible to the Mithrest Inn in Waukeen's Promenade.~
@662  = ~However, we do not have time to go there now, Ajantis.~
@663  = ~Well, so it shall be. We will go to the Mithrest Inn in Waukeen's Promenade once we reach Athkatla.~
@664  = ~Even if we could get there from here, we wouldn't have the time to go to the shop, Ajantis.~
@665  = ~How convenient that we are already here.~
@666  = ~(shy smile) I have not dared to buy another present without you, beloved.~
@667  = ~I already met master Surianko there.~
@668  = ~Is there no other way to obtain wedding rings?~
@669  = ~If our duty should prevent us from going there, there is also the possibility of having sample rings sent, <CHARNAME>. Tell me if you prefer this alternative.~
@670  = ~I do not know of any, <CHARNAME>, but I am happy to provide the wedding rings from elsewhere if you have another proposal.~
@671  = ~No, I know of no other goldsmith.~
@672  = ~Well, then it will probably remain master Surianko's wares.~
@673  = ~How am I to know a goldsmith in Amn?~
@674  = ~You are already widely traveled. Have you met no other goldsmith on your journeys?~
@675  = ~Well, it will probably remain master Surianko's wares.~
@676  = ~I can assure you, <CHARNAME>: Master Surianko's rings are of high quality and his artful forging is known far beyond the borders of Amn.~
@677  = ~Then it remains the ring which I have already chosen, Ajantis.~
@678  = ~Now I need only measure your very delicate finger, beloved, so that the ring will fit perfectly. Would you give me your hand?...~
@679  = ~(smile) Here, please, Ajantis.~
@680  = ~Gladly.~
@681  = ~(sigh) If need be...~
@682  = ~That is not a problem. There is the possibility of having sample rings sent for us to inspect. I will send master Surianko a message as soon as possible, telling him that we wish this. If our obligations should leave us the time to stop by his shop, then we can gladly do so.~
@683  = ~I thank you. Let me quickly take measurements with this piece of string...~
@684  = ~I am sorry if it is uncomfortable for you, but I do not want to risk mistakes. I thank you. Let me quickly take measurements with this piece of string...~
@685  = ~It is a miracle, how tender and nevertheless strong your finger is, <CHARNAME>... what beautiful, fine fingers you have. These extremely delicate joints...~
@686  = ~(embarrassed coughing) I... I should perhaps let go of your hand again.~
@687  = ~Not without a kiss for me from my very charming admirer.~
@688  = ~It's fine, Ajantis.~
@689  = ~Indeed.~
@690  = ~Then all of it is resolved. I am immensely looking forward to our wedding, beloved! It is so close now!~
@691  = ~I do not want to harass, beloved...~
@692  = ~I will do so gladly! The quiet moment we have chosen to speak allows it.  Everything else has been said. I am immensely looking forward to our wedding, beloved! It is so close now!~
@693  = ~And now you get your kiss. (softly) How much I enjoy these moments with you, beloved...~

@694  = ~There has been no way to send a message yet. We must first go to an area from which Athkatla can be reached.~
@695  = ~I sent a message to master goldsmith Surianko. If we are in a place where his messenger can find us, the bag should reach us in two days.~
@696  = ~I could send a message to master goldsmith Surianko, asking him to send us a bag with sample rings. If I dispatch the message immediately, the bag should reach us in two days.~
@697  = ~Yes, please do it, Ajantis. I am afraid that we do not have time to go to the jewellery shop.~
@698  = ~No, that is not necessary. We will go to the goldsmith as soon as we can.~
@699  = ~As you wish. I will send the message as soon as possible.~
@700  = ~Lady Eleiana is a confirmed knight of the Order and was my leader in the Windspear Hills mission.~
@701  = ~As you surely know already, 'Lord' Jierdan sent a message to the Order. It was a request for help against an alleged orc band that was troubling the Windspear Hills. Jierdan is renowned for his machinations against our friend Lord Windspear, and therefore not popular, but he was recognized as a Lord, and naturally the Order could not let such a call go unanswered. So I was deployed under the leadership of knight Eleiana to explore the matter and, if necessary, to fight the monsters.~
@702  = ~Go on.~
@703  = ~I would not like to hear it in so much detail, Ajantis.~
@704  = ~We had hardly entered the Windspear Hills when the area was strangely obfuscated. We fought against monsters... but it was like a dream, a nightmare from which we awoke only when you stood before us. I do not know how long we were trapped in that prison. I can calculate the days of course, but time in there passed... differently.~
@705  = ~I find the incident shameful and would prefer to hide it. But I think you have a right to know what happened. Perhaps ... perhaps it can save us from a similar experience in the future.~
@706  = ~Maybe it is not quite fair of me... I find the incident shameful and would prefer to hide it. But I think you have a right to know what happened. Perhaps... perhaps it can save us from a similar experience in the future.~
@707  = ~What... what do you mean, beloved? Men and women are equal in the struggle for good.~
@708  = ~Well, it took me by surprise, that is all. You miss your betrothed, yet you go running around in the mountains with four women...~
@709  = ~It's all right, Ajantis.~
@710  = ~This is the second time that you have spoken of this! What bothers you so? As I said, men and women are equal in the fight against evil. You know this best of all!~
@711  = ~There is nothing about the context that should alarm you. It was an uncertain and dangerous mission, and we were merely comrades-in-arms. I assure you that the gender distribution of the troop was a coincidence. There... there is only one who woke special feelings in me, and you are and remain that one, my beloved <CHARNAME>.~
@712  = ~And what do you believe we were doing there? It was an uncertain and dangerous mission, and we were comrades-in-arms, no more! I can assure you that the gender distribution of the group was a coincidence.~
@713  = ~I only meant to tease you. No need to get angry!~
@714  = ~Well, somebody decided it, if it wasn't you, though.~
@715  = ~I think the gender composition was more than inappropriate in light of your personal situation at the time.~

@717  = ~(softly) ...There is only one who has aroused feelings in me, and you are and remain she, <CHARNAME>, beloved.~
@718  = ~We swear eternal love in full awareness of the circumstances under which we live our lives, <CHARNAME>. We may not know what fate holds for us, but we have within our power how we will react to it.~
@719  = ~This has reassured me, thank you.~
@720  = ~I admire Sir Mahlam's sacrifice. It makes me proud to know that you would have done the same. I know that it does not mean you do not love me, or love me too little, if one day you also sacrifice yourself for your comrades or for innocents. I know that you will not intentionally remain away, if I should be at home, waiting for you.~
@721  = ~Ajantis, I cannot rid myself of the fear that you will one day have to choose between your duty to the Order and myself... and that you will choose the Order.~
@722  = ~The circumstances would have to be terrible for me to do so.~
@723  = ~You are right. I spoke as if I believed you *wanted* to be away from me. You have reassured me, thank you.~

@725  = ~There is bitterness in your words.~
@726  = ~No, not bitterness, rather disbelief about your behavior.~
@727  = ~Yes, there is.~
@728  = ~I considered the matter carefully, and I was sure that I had done everything possible to find you before I undertook this task. Believe me, my soul was devastated with concern for you.~
@729  = ~Well, that is good to know. Your words give me at least some confidence.~
@730  = ~That is great to know, but brings me nothing if you place the interests of the Order over your betrothed, or perhaps later your family.~
@731  = ~<CHARNAME>, I have given my life in service to the Order. I am ready to yield it in Helm's name and for righteousness. We have already talked about this, and I thought you understood?~
@732  = ~Yes, I did. I think I just need some time... but your words do reassure some of my fears.~
@733  = ~So am I to believe that you could go to death at any time for complete strangers, leaving me a widow and our children... fatherless?~
@734  = ~'Our children'? Do you have something to tell me?~
@735  = ~No, I'm not pregnant, it was meant hypothetically.~
@736  = ~Of course not, do not try to change the subject!~
@737  = ~The answer to your question is yes. As I am expected to fulfill my duties as a knight of the Order, my family is also expected to place its interests in the service of the Order.~
@738  = ~But as the Order expects that we serve it, it does the same for us. So you may be sure, <CHARNAME>. My brethren and sisters of the Order are there for you. They will protect you, if I cannot.~
@739  = ~Thank you for telling me this. It makes me feel a little better about this.~
@740  = ~I do not want your brothers and sisters of the Order, I want you, as my husband, as the father of our children.~
@741  = ~Beloved, I will always be there for you and our children, as best I can. That is all I can promise you.~
@742  = ~Yes, I know... It is just a contradiction in my eyes. A parent has obligations to his children. For a paladin, it must be all the more true.~
@743  = ~That they are well provided for, secure, and free to grow up in peace.~
@744  = ~That they grow up with *both* of their parents there for them! You would give your life so that the children of strangers grow up with *their* parents in peace. What about your own?!~

@747  = ~Your dedication to the fight for righteousness is admirable... I only hope I will understand, in time. I will try to be a worthy wife for you and to enjoy what time we do have together.~
@748  = ~I don't know... I do not feel satisfied with this answer, but I cannot expect more, I suppose.~
@749  = ~I fight against evil for the good of *all* children, <CHARNAME>! How can I protect my children better than when I fight the evil in this world?~

@754  = ~What thoughts trouble you, beloved?~
@755  = ~Well, will it always be like this? We are not even married, yet already I was kidnapped by an evil mage, to a place where you could not find me, and a sinister dragon created illusions causing me to believe I had killed you... How will this end?~
@756  = ~But this is not common knowledge in the city, and I would not know where this asylum would be.~

@757  = ~Nothing, actually. No need to talk about it. All is well.~
@758  = ~We were strong enough to defeat this evil. Our *love* was strong enough to survive this, beloved, and it will remain so if we both wish. I want it with all my heart, and I will give all my strength for it.~
@759  = ~Your words give me confidence, Ajantis, thank you.~
@760  = ~Nevertheless, the concern remains. I hope we are strong enough for what will come.~
@761  = ~That was cruel. I am grateful that you did not lose your faith, beloved. And I admire your strength: I do not know if I could have endured seeing your supposedly dead body in front of me. Especially with the knowledge that I had committed the horrible deed myself... how did you go on?~
@762  = ~I was beside myself when I believed I recognized your dead body in the Windspear Hills... Had I searched for you for all this time, only to kill you upon our meeting?~
@763  = ~I was desperate. Fortunately, things soon developed in such a way that we could believe you were not lost.~
@764  = ~Something was strange about the situation, Ajantis. I had a feeling that not all was as it appeared to be.~
@765  = ~Well, everything is well now, at least.~
@766  = ~I believe you, beloved. To know that a friend is dead is difficult enough. How terrible was your pain, as you must have believed you had slain me, your betrothed! I pray that I am spared such a terrible experience.~
@767  = ~That it is. Nevertheless, it was certainly not easy for you, beloved. To know that a friend is dead is difficult enough. How terrible was your pain, as you must have believed you had killed me, your betrothed! I pray that I am spared such a terrible experience.~
@768  = ~Yes, with your keen senses, such a deception could not remain concealed. Nevertheless, I believe that the first moment after the fight must have been a shock for you.~
@769  = ~I am pleased, beloved! Thank you.~
@770  = ~I am sorry to hear that, <CHARNAME>. You rejected it, but still I had the hope that it could please you. Well, do as you will. I do not ask that you keep it, although I think it is a beautiful picture of you... I shall try to better match your taste with my next gift!~
@771  = ~No, the image of both of us is quite nice. I will keep the pendant, I think, even if I will not wear it.~
@772  = ~Sorry, perhaps I should not have spoken. But I prefer to tell you my honest opinion.~
@773  = ~Well, yes. Perhaps in the future you could ask for my opinion before you buy me a gift.~
@774  = ~I am grateful for this. It is better than if you held an unspoken resentment.~
@775  = ~I will keep the pendant, even if I will not wear it.~
@776  = ~I cannot promise you that I will always do so, beloved, as large as the temptation sometimes is to surprise you. But once in our common life I will succeed in meeting your taste!~
@777  = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>. As I said, I will do *everything* so that you feel loved and happy. In addition, our restraint serves a useful purpose.~
@778  = ~Occasionally, I will look admiringly at you, my beloved, as the sight of your beauty makes me very happy.~
@779  = ~(breathlessly) Is this true? <CHARNAME>, your words fill me with great desire... and anticipation of what may happen soon. Thank you, beloved.~
@780  = ~(breathlessly) Is this true? <CHARNAME>, your words fill me with great desire...~
@781  = ~(moan) Thank you, beloved. But let us remove this thing soon... Now it is becoming even more painful for me!~
@782  = ~I was looking for you, beloved, but only with a few selected brothers of the Order. I knew not where you were, and... Well, I had to make sure that you *wanted* to be found.~
@783  = ~Let me clarify. We both know the circumstances of your departure from Baldur's Gate was not... ideal. Plus, I would never intrude upon you if you wished to leave me, ahem. But the Order would have been able to suspect this. We have many duties, and searching for the missing partner of one of our brothers is only one of them.~
@784  = ~Yes, I can imagine, although it would be welcome if the search for missing relatives was a very high priority.~
@785  = ~Are you saying that there are things more important than finding the wife of another knight who has disappeared?~
@786  = ~Well, that is good to know. Let us continue on, now.~
@787  = ~The disappearance of a relative would be only one of the evils in this world that we knights struggle against.~
@788  = ~That is true, now that you mention it. Let us continue on, now.~
@789  = ~(bitter) Well, you definitely proved that sufficiently, since you went hunting monsters, even though I had disappeared to gods knew where.~
@790  = ~What you are saying hurts me, and I hope I can convince you that it is not true. I had long searched for you and found no trace of you. I... began to despair. I think I needed the distraction that a mission brought. After it, I would have had renewed vigor in my search for you, which is fortunately no longer necessary.~
@791  = ~I'm sorry, I did not want to hurt you. It is simply hard for me... that you were not there when I needed you so badly.~
@792  = ~No, I cannot believe that you gave up so quickly. You should have made a greater effort.~
@793  = ~Your answer pains me, beloved. I hope I can soothe your bitterness and prove my concern and love, now that we are together again.~
@794  = ~It... it pains me, too. I hope I can soothe your pain and prove my concern and love, now that we are together again.~
@795  = ~All too gladly will I tell you.~
@796  = ~Please, continue.~
@797  = ~The rest I also know, I think.~
@798  = ~I arrived here and the Order gave me its blessing for our wedding, if your path continues for good and righteousness, <CHARNAME>.~
@799  = ~Yes, you do, if you read my letters, because I wrote the last shortly before my departure to the Windspear Hills. Believe me, it was not easy for me to see you missing on the day of my knighting, but I had to take that step.~
@800  = ~Of course. I understand your motivation, although I would have been very glad to be able to attend it.~
@801  = ~I am disappointed that you were belted to knight without me, Ajantis.~
@802  = ~Well, then we know the most important things.~
@803  = ~Besides... I was found worthy by the Order to be belted to the title of knight. Believe me, it was not easy for me, with you missing on that day. But I had to take that step.~
@804  = ~Also my knighting took place here, as you already know.~
@805  = ~Then you know the most important things. I am so glad to return to your side, <CHARNAME>, beloved.~
@806  = ~And I as well. I love you, Ajantis.~
@807  = ~I am very happy as well.~
@808  = ~Yes, let us continue.~
@809  = ~Let us move forward and work together to counter the dangers.~
@810  = ~And I love you. Let us move forward and work together to counter the dangers.~
@811  = ~So it is. I am so glad to return to your side, <CHARNAME>, beloved.~
@812  = ~I had written you letters, which I had stored in the Order, since they could not reach you... I did not reach my parents in Waterdeep, as we had agreed upon. I was recalled by the Order, since the tensions at the Sword Coast made many missions by the Order necessary.~
@813  = ~...And you let yourself be belted to knighthood. I know that already.~
@814  = ~...Where you were knighted. I know that already.~
@815  = ~So it is, <CHARNAME>. I see you have already received information about me. Believe me, it was not easy, with you missing on that day. But I had to take that step.~
@816  = ~So it is, <CHARNAME>. We have already spoken about it.~
@817  = ~Yes, that is true. The Order found me worthy to be belted to the title of knight. Believe me, it was not easy, with you missing on that day.  But I had to take that step.~
@818  = ~I am relieved that you understand. I love you, <CHARNAME>. How gladly I would have shared that day with you.~
@819  = ~I love you, too, Ajantis.~
@820  = ~Yes, it would have been nice.~
@821  = ~Well, let us continue.~
@822  = ~I understand, but you must also understand me. My time as a squire was over, the Order found me worthy. I could no longer hesitate.~
@823  = ~I love you, <CHARNAME>. How gladly I would have shared that day with you.~
@824  = ~Yes, it would have been nice, but now it's too late.~
@825  = ~You sound upset, and I am sorry. I hope you can one day understand my reasons, <CHARNAME>.~
@826  = ~I still have no news of them. I will immediately tell you when the time comes.~
@827  = ~I... I still have no answer.~
@828  = ~What will their response be? Will they give their consent?~
@829  = ~Well, I guess this needs to be considered.  Please tell me at once when you know their answer.~
@830  = ~When will you get their answer?~
@831  = ~How long will this take? When do we finally marry?~
@832  = ~I cannot imagine that they do not trust my judgement... or the Order's! But... they were so distant when I discussed this with them. (hesitates) I must be honest, <CHARNAME>; I await my parent's answer with quite a bit of trepidation.~
@833  = ~I will. They have arranged their business trip so that it will once again pass through Athkatla. I will tell you when the time comes.~
@834  = ~Well, we will see.~
@835  = ~They have arranged their business trip so that it will once again pass through Athkatla. I will tell you about it when the time comes.~
@836  = ~Let us wait for my parents' answer, <CHARNAME>, please! They have arranged their business trip so that it will once again pass through Athkatla. I will tell you about it when the time comes.~
@837  = ~What a crime, even at so small an item! May I take it, <CHARNAME>? I will have a new ring forged from them so that it may once again grace your delicate finger.~
@838  = ~Yes, take the fragments, Ajantis.~
@839  = ~I had been hoping for this, to be honest. Anything else would not feel right.~
@840  = ~No, I don't want this.~
@841  = ~This is both unfortunate and exasperating! But do not grieve, beloved. I will have a new, untainted ring forged for you, so that it may once more grace your delicate finger.~
@842  = ~Let me stow them so that they do not waste space... I will send them to a goldsmith at the earliest opportunity.~
@843  = ~What do you mean?~
@844  = ~I do not want the pieces forged into a 'second' engagement ring, Ajantis. It was destroyed by evil beings... and stained by the terrible memories formed in that place. I would rather have an entirely new engagement ring.~
@845  = ~Well, you must not forge a ring because I want to separate from you.~
@846  = ~No, I have changed my mind. Take the pieces, Ajantis. It is a beautiful idea to repair the engagement ring from it.~
@847  = ~No, I changed my mind. It is a beautiful idea to repair the engagement ring from the fragments. I know still where they are to be found, and I will get them for you.~
@848  = ~This is both regrettable and annoying! Give me the pieces when you have them again. I will have a new ring forged from them so that it may once again grace your delicate finger.~
@849  = ~That sounds nice. I still know where to find them, and will give them to you.~
@850  = ~Unfortunately, I do not remember where they are, Ajantis.~
@851  = ~Do not worry, beloved. I will forge a new ring for you, one without stain!~
@852  = ~Since the ring will require a new jewel, it need not be a luck-bringing turquoise, as it once was. Have you another desire, perhaps?~
@853  = ~No, I want the engagement ring to look like it originally did, with a light blue stone.~
@854  = ~Yes, I would prefer a green stone in the ring.~
@855  = ~Well, I would like a red colored gemstone better.~
@856  = ~A yellow gemstone would please me best, Ajantis.~
@857  = ~I would prefer a colorless jewel in the ring.~
@858  = ~Let the gemstone be gone, it is lost. Forge me a plain, stoneless ring from the fragments.~
@859  = ~I would rather not decide this just now.~
@860  = ~The ring is an heirloom of my family, so you had no choice as to what it would look like. I apologize if I forge a similar ring, but I wish for the new ring to be like the original. The precious stone, which adorns it, need not be the same. Will you choose the color of the gemstone? Should it be another luck-bringing turquoise?~
@861  = ~Yes, I want the engagement ring to look like it originally did, with a light blue stone.~
@862  = ~No, I would prefer a green stone in the ring.~
@863  = ~I would like to have a plain, stoneless ring, without a gemstone.~
@864  = ~As you say. I would be happy to fulfill this wish for you!~
@865  = ~Then think on it in peace, but please do not take too much time. I would like to give you the ring before our wedding. If necessary, I will simply have it forged to match the original.~
@866  = ~Are you sure? A colorless star sapphire traditionally adorns the ring of a married woman, <CHARNAME>.~
@867  = ~Well, then I want the engagement ring to look like it originally did, with a light blue stone.~
@868  = ~Well, then I would prefer a green stone in the ring.~
@869  = ~If so, I would like red as the color of the gemstone.~
@870  = ~Under these circumstances, I would like a yellow gemstone best, Ajantis.~
@871  = ~Then I would like a plain, stoneless ring, without a gemstone.~
@872  = ~I do not care for these traditions. Give my engagement ring such a jewel.~
@873  = ~Excellent! Let me know when you have them.~
@874  = ~You... What?!~
@875  = ~Yes, I no longer see you as my betrothed. Let us end the engagement.~
@876  = ~No, what am I saying? All is well, Ajantis.~
@877  = ~Beloved, please... do not frighten me so!~
@878  = ~I would not like for the pieces to be processed into a 'second' engagement ring, Ajantis. It was destroyed by evil beings... and stained by the memories formed in that place. I want an entirely new engagement ring.~
@879  = ~Take the pieces, Ajantis. It is a beautiful idea to repair the engagement ring from them.~
@880  = ~Actually it's a nice idea to make the engagement ring from the pieces again. I still know where to find them, and will give them to you.~
@881  = ~Excellent! Let me stow them so that they do not waste space...~
@882  = ~Very happily, <CHARNAME>! It is not too late. Let me get the pieces stowed so that they are not wasting space...~
@883  = ~I will have a new, unstained ring forged for you.~
@884  = ~Have you decided which color of stone to have?~
@885  = ~I want the engagement ring to look like it originally did, with a light blue stone.~
@886  = ~I would prefer a green stone in the ring.~
@887  = ~It remains my choice. I would prefer a colorless jewel in the ring.~
@888  = ~Wonderful. What color should it be?~
@889  = ~As you say. I would be happy to fulfill this wish for you! I will send a message to the goldsmith as soon as possible.~
@890  = ~It is all right, <CHARNAME>... It is the loss of the sentimental value that grieves me the most, but it had to be done, and now it is over.~
@891  = ~I know, my love, but there is nothing I can do. The shield is no longer my property. I could not keep it, as it would be equal to stealing it...~
@892  = ~As soon as we have it back, I will send it to Waterdeep, to its rightful owners.~
@893  = ~You ... You want to dissolve our betrothal? Just like that?~
@894  = ~Are you deaf? Yes, I do not see you as my betrothed any longer. Let us end the engagement.~
@895  = ~Are you deaf? Yes, I do not see you as my beloved any longer. Marrying you was a mistake, and I would like for you to go.~
@896  = ~You have sworn an oath, <CHARNAME>. Let me remind you of your duties as my bride!~
@897  = ~Ajantis, I'm really sorry, but it would not make any sense. Please, accept the decision and let me go.~
@898  = ~This is one of the reasons why a marriage with you is no longer viable, Ajantis. Would you not prefer to see me happy?~
@899  = ~You are threatening me with the law? An engagement is by far not as binding as a marriage, Ajantis, and we are not yet married!~
@900  = ~No, you are right, Ajantis. I am your betrothed, and I will stand by it. Let's just go on.~
@901  = ~I know... I know that it makes no sense. You are very strong-willed. No, I do not threaten you with the law. There is no reason, if the betrothed agree. I... I release you from your duties as my betrothed... beloved. Thus, it seems... our engagement is hereby dissolved. You are the light in my heart, and I owe you my life...~
@902  = ~I... I will continue to support you as long as you have use for me. Let us move on... and not speak of this.~
@903  = ~It is not as simple as that! You have sworn an oath, <CHARNAME>. Let me remind you of your duties as my wife!~
@904  = ~You are threatening me with the law? Why? Don't you want me to be happy?~
@905  = ~No, you are right, Ajantis. I am your wife, and I will stand by it. Let's just go on.~
@906  = ~I know... I know that it makes no sense. You are very strong-willed. No, I do not threaten you with the law. There is no reason, if the husband sets his wife free. You... You are free. I release you from your duties as my wife, beloved.~
@907  = ~That... that means, we cannot continue to remain together. Our union was for our life. I... I will go and forget in my missions from the Order. Live... live well.~
@908  = ~(Your faces are close now. You feel Ajantis' breath on your cheek. It takes a tiny bit longer than necessary until he lets you get on your feet again. On his forehead, a thoughtful frown shows...)~
@909  = ~I am sorry, my lady. I am deep in thought.~
@910  = ~Indeed. Well, I will not disturb you then.~
@911  = ~Ajantis, you are still pale. Don't you want to tell me what was written in the message?~
@912  = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, but no, I cannot.~
@913  = ~It is personal... it was a message from my parents. Never I would have thought...~
@914  = ~Forgive me, I got carried away. I do not wish to discuss this with you. Not... not now, at least.~
@915  = ~No, please leave me my privacy. I assure you my vigilance is unbroken.~
@916  = ~Ajantis, can't you see I am worried?!~
@917  = ~I... I thank you deeply for your concern. It means very much to me, my lady. But I... (moan) I cannot talk about this. Not now.~
@918  = ~Please, my lady, if this is a kind of game, stop doing this... It is very distracting!~
@919  = ~Ajantis, I welcome your attention, but please stop flirting with me for now.~
@920  = ~As you wish, my lady.~
@921  = ~Wait a minute, Ajantis, you have something there...~
@922  = ~There is something in your hair...~
@923  = ~There is a spot on your armor...~
@924  = ~There is an eyelash on your cheek...~
@925  = ~(You reach with your hand as to remove what you might see in Ajantis' hair.)~
@926  = ~Thank you very much, my lady.~
@927  = ~(Ajantis leans slightly over, so you can reach better, looking at your hand.)~
@928  = ~(When your eyes meet again, he is looking at you, intensely.)~
@929  = ~Oh?~
@930  = ~I would be grateful if you would remove it, my lady.~
@931  = ~It can only be something small, my lady.~
@932  = ~(Ajantis holds still, so you are able to pick what you spotted.)~
@933  = ~(Ajantis holds still, but you notice a slight frown on his forehead.)~
@934  = ~(He moves on, without any further comments.)~
@935  = ~(He gives you an affirmative nod, before turning away again.)~
@936  = ~Really? Where?~
@937  = ~The ring is beautiful, Ajantis. Thank you!~
@938  = ~Thank you for the ring, although it is not really my taste...~
@939  = ~I am glad you say so, my love.~
@940  = ~I am sorry to hear that, my love.~
@941  = ~I was hoping so much that I could adorn your finger with the Ilvastarr family ring, <CHARNAME>...~
@942  = ~Forgive me, I shouldn't raise this topic. Nothing has happened yet. We will see what time brings. For now, we have to focus on staying alive and destroying our foe.~
@943  = ~Don't you think hell is a rather... unnatural place to make a marriage proposal?~
@944  = ~Of course I do, love. But I figured it was long past time to let you know.~
@945  = ~I spent so long adoring you in silence...~
@946  = ~(With red ears) Let us concentrate on our duty, love. There will be time for talking afterwards.~
@947  = ~(You point at the place that you say needs polishing.)~
@948  = ~(You touch the armor on his chest with your hand. You and Ajantis are close now.)~
@949  = ~Here, you say? Seems I have to take a closer look once we stop for a rest, my lady.~
@950  = ~Indeed, this could use some polishing... But for now, it will do.~
@951  = ~Hm, I fear this is the best I can give... after traveling as much as we did. I will polish it spotless tonight. Thank you for pointing it out to me, my lady.~
@952  = ~(Ajantis regards you intensely, and you share a look.)~
@953  = ~(When you take away your hand, Ajantis starts to move.)~
@954  = ~Thank you very much for showing me, my lady... (cough)~
@955  = ~(You can smell the leather of his armor belts. Under your hand, you feel Ajantis's chest moving.)~
@956  = ~(clears his throat) Thank you for... for pointing that out to me, my lady.~
@957  = ~(Ajantis flinches slightly when you touch him. He stares at your hand on his chest.)~
@958  = ~(When he finally raises his head, you see that his cheeks have reddened.)~
@959  = ~My senses are at such unrest, it is hurting. All I feel is the evil surrounding us.~
@960  = ~Let us fulfill our task and leave this evil place. I will not relax until we have accomplished this.~
@961  = ~Let us help the silver dragon, and let it be quick.~
@962  = ~This is not the moment to discuss this. Let us finish our task and leave this evil place.~
@963  = ~We have to be careful where we step. In this abyss, you are more vulnerable than ever.~
@964  = ~You are a very capable fighter, Ajantis.~
@965  = ~It is good to have you around, Ajantis.~
@966  = ~I thank you for the compliment, my lady.~
@967  = ~I do a lot of training, my lady, to be able to fulfill my duty.~
@968  = ~With all due respect, I am not as good as you are at your own profession. But, thank you.~
@969  = ~I am doing my duty, for my god and my Order.~
@970  = ~These are very kind words, my lady.~
@971  = ~As I enjoy being with you. (cough) I meant traveling with you.~
@972  = ~Thank you, my lady.~
@973  = ~(Ajantis holds still so you can reach.)~
@974  = ~(You smile at Ajantis.)~
@975  = ~(He doesn't look into your eyes. When you have finished, he turns away quickly.)~
@976  = ~Thank you, my lady.~
@977  = ~(Ajantis's cheek seems to redden under your touch. When your eyes meet, Ajantis does not look away.)~
@978  = ~(You feel Ajantis' breath on your palm. He gives you an intense look.)~
@979  = ~That was very kind of you, my lady.~
@980  = ~(Ajantis looks at you, surprised. He then smiles shyly and turns away.)~
@981  = ~(Ajantis briefly smiles back at you.)~
@982  = ~Your smile is like a beautiful sunrise, my lady. If I may say so.~
@983  = ~(Ajantis gives you an affirmative nod. You notice his ears reddening, though.)~
@984  = ~Yes?~ [c#ablank]
@985  = ~(whispers) Be careful with these gentle gestures here in this evil place, my lady.~
@986  = ~Thank you for this ray of sunshine in this dark place, my lady.~
@987  = ~I am glad to see you didn't lose your good spirits, my lady.~
@988  = ~Thank you, my lady. I hope good enough for what we have to face here.~
@989  = ~(Ajantis notices your attention and turns to you.) Yes, my l... Veldrin?~
@990  = ~(You feel like teasing Ajantis a bit.)~
@991  = ~(Slap Ajantis on his back.) That's what drow do to their males, no?~
@992  = ~(Give Ajantis your heaviest item to carry.) Take that for me, male.~
@993  = ~Male, I want you to clean my boots when we halt for a rest.~
@994  = ~You look sexy, Ajantis... A real hot male drow.~
@995  = ~(Ajantis nearly jumps forward.) My lady!~
@996  = ~Do not... overdo with your efforts of assimilation, my lady... please.~
@997  = ~When I said we have to be careful, I did not mean you should imitate... this... behavior!~
@998  = ~I will, of course, do so if you (ugh) please.~
@999  = ~Of course, my lady, albeit I have the impression you do not really need my assistance with this.~
@1000 = ~Give me whatever you want me to carry for you, my lady.~
@1001 = ~I'd... rather you did not say something like that.~
@1002 = ~My lady! I never would have expected such a comment from your mouth.~
@1003 = ~Why are you saying this? Do not let yourself get distracted with whatever thoughts you might have had. (reddens)~
@1004 = ~Thank you for this ray of sunshine in this dark place, my love.~
@1005 = ~I am glad to see you didn't lose your good spirits in this evil place, my love.~
@1006 = ~(Ajantis smiles back at you, his eyes full of tenderness.)~
@1007 = ~The sun just shone, my love.~
@1008 = ~(Ajantis gives you a smile, his eyes beaming.) I am so proud to have you here, my love.~
@1009 = ~I loathe this place. Let us be vigilant until we find our way out of this nightmare.~
@1010 = ~You have some interest in Eila, don't you? What a fine looking woman.~
@1011 = ~It is wrong only to focus on looks. You also have to consider her inner beauty, her fondness of family, her kindness, her friendliness, and her courage!~
@1012 = ~I... I am not sure why we are discussing this.~
@1013 = ~I just thought I saw her... Only to notice it was a complete stranger. Her presence makes my heart rejoice, it is like a ray of sunshine on a cloudy day. (reddens)~
@1014 = ~I don't like the tone you use when talking about her. I expect you to keep your hands to yourself the next time we meet her.~
@1015 = ~My apologies... I feel very protective towards her, as it seems. (ahem)~
@1016 = ~She is... like a beautiful flower. Fragile, and yet overwhelming the senses of the onlooker.~
@1017 = ~(cough) It seems my feelings are no secret. Let us concentrate on our duty.~
@1018 = ~I left her as a child and meet her as a woman...~
@1019 = ~Never a woman has stunned me the way she did. But this is definitely none of your business.~
@1020 = ~Do I have dirt on my face?~
@1021 = ~Let me see... (Ajantis looks at your face, taking care to check every single bit of skin.)~
@1022 = ~My apologies, a knight shouldn't stare into a lady's face this intensely, even if it is a pleasant sight. (ahem)~
@1023 = ~I do not see any dirt on your face, my lady.~
@1024 = ~(Ajantis lets his eyes wander over your face carefully. He raises his hand, as if to turn your head by touching your cheek, but quickly takes it away before he touches you, blushing.)~
@1025 = ~Hm, I think you indeed have a little spot here...~
@1026 = ~(Ajantis touches your cheek with his palm, carefully wiping your skin with his thumb. Your faces are close as he leans over to see better.)~
@1027 = ~(With his hand still on your cheek, your eyes meet. You have the impression Ajantis freezes for a very small moment, before taking his hand away, reddening.)~
@1028 = ~That... that would be all, my lady.~
@1029 = ~Yes, I see a little spot, right here under your eye. (Ajantis touches his face to show you, unaware he just placed a spot on his own face.)~
@1030 = ~Now you have a spot there, too.~
@1031 = ~(giggle) That was a very impressive presentation, thank you.~
@1032 = ~Would you be so kind and remove it? But, please, use a clean finger. If you have one.~
@1033 = ~How clumsy, to place dirt on my face like this! Please excuse me, my lady.~
@1034 = ~A clean finger? But of course I would... Oh, I see what you mean.~
@1035 = ~Now my fingers are clean and also my face, I hope. Do you want me to take care of the spot on your face?~
@1036 = ~Yes, please.~
@1037 = ~No, I'm fine.~
@1038 = ~Of course.~
@1039 = ~(Ajantis carefully wipes away the dirt from your face.) How soft your skin is...~
@1040 = ~Ajantis, who would be your queen of love and beauty?~
@1041 = ~Ah, I see you know of knightly traditions. It is not uncommon for a knight to choose a queen of beauty. She is a symbol of good luck and fortune, and usually she is also a young lady the knight secretly admires.~
@1042 = ~But you asked me about my queen of beauty, my lady. There is only one woman who would qualify for this. She is the most outstanding, courageous, and beautiful woman I ever met...~
@1043 = ~(with red ears) Lady <CHARNAME> would be my queen of beauty, my lady. I... I hope I did not overstep my bounds with this remark.~
@1044 = ~Not at all. I would love to be your queen of beauty, Ajantis.~
@1045 = ~It's all right.~
@1046 = ~Well, I should know better than to ask such a question.~
@1047 = ~My apologies, my lady, as you do not seem to be pleased by the thought.~
@1048 = ~It was my pleasure.~
@1049 = ~You would?...~
@1050 = ~See this ribbon? I am tying it to your arm as a favor.~
@1051 = ~I suppose I had better not.~
@1052 = ~My lady... This is very kind of you. I will... I will honor this gesture you bestow on me. It means a lot to me, my lady.~
@1053 = ~Look at what Irenicus' henchmen have done with your engagement ring...~
@1054 = ~It is unfortunate about the ring... but it had long ago lost meaning. Now the fragments symbolize what happened with our relationship.~
@1055 = ~Forgive me, <CHARNAME>, but that is what I thought when I saw it.~
@1056 = ~Leave me be, <PLAYER3>! I endure your evil presence in my vicinity only because <CHARNAME> would have it so... My patience will not be eternal, however.~
@1057 = ~Leave me be, <PLAYER4>! I endure your evil presence in my vicinity only because <CHARNAME> would have it so... My patience will not be eternal, however.~
@1058 = ~Leave me be, <PLAYER5>! I endure your evil presence in my vicinity only because <CHARNAME> would have it so... My patience will not be eternal, however.~
@1059 = ~Leave me be, <PLAYER6>! I endure your evil presence in my vicinity only because <CHARNAME> would have it so... My patience will not be eternal, however.~
@1060 = ~Don't Keldorn's family problems make you think, Ajantis? Aren't you afraid that something similar could happen to you and your future wife?~
@1061 = ~I am glad that you asked me about this. I am surprised how a knight of the Order could act against the law in such a way.~
@1062 = ~But I already told him so.~
@1063 = ~What do you think about Keldorn's reaction to the infidelity of his wife, Ajantis?~
@1064 = ~I don't want to talk about it further.~
@1065 = ~If you wish.~
@1066 = ~Me and my... future wife? Well, if she does not pursue such an adventurous life like you do (ahem), but indeed stays at home, I take it that she will be aware of what it means to be married to a knight of the Order. I will be away often, but I will show her my endless love whenever I can.~
@1067 = ~(blushes) Could you... imagine being married to a knight, my lady? Would small signs of care, like letters and little presents, make the times of separation more bearable? If there would be any times of separation, of course...~
@1068 = ~If I love him and know he loves me, I am sure we would find a way.~
@1069 = ~Of course, although it might be my husband who stays at home, while I do my duty.~
@1070 = ~Hm, I am not sure... Since I will lead such a life myself, I would prefer my husband to be at a place where I know where he is.~
@1071 = ~I think it would be difficult. I am not sure I would want that.~
@1072 = ~No, to be honest, it wouldn't.~
@1073 = ~No?... Well, I... Maybe it is best not to discuss such personal matters. We should return to our duties.~
@1074 = ~You could be sure of his love, my lady. I... I wanted to say that I am sure that you will have a husband who will love you very much. (cough)~
@1075 = ~Yes, you could be in the same situation with your husband like I would be with my wife... Except in the case that he was a paladin as well. We would... I mean he and you would travel together. (cough)~
@1076 = ~Well, he would not necessarily have to wait at home for this, my lady. It could well be that he is a paladin, too, and we would... I mean he and you would travel together. (cough)~
@1077 = ~Difficult does not mean impossible, though.~
@1078 = ~I will tell him so, on the next appropriate occasion.~
@1079 = ~It ended well for all involved. That is what counts.~
@1080 = ~Even my mentor should not decide it by himself. Sir Keldorn put himself above the law. As a man of duty and paladin of Helm, I cannot approve of such behavior.~
@1081 = ~I do not want to see Maria or the family suffer. But it is not for me to decide.~
@1082 = ~These words from you, a follower of Helm?! Duty to one's cause outweighs all, and you know that!~ [c#ajan24]
@1083 = ~Yes, it took me by surprise as well. I thought fulfilling the law was the most important obligation for a knight.~
@1084 = ~We share the same opinion, as it seems.~
@1085 = ~You would approve of Keldorn's wife going to prison?~
@1086 = ~I am surprised to hear such a question from a follower of Helm!~
@1087 = ~It is a hard fate, yet Sir Keldorn did the right thing by following the law.~
@1088 = ~Yes, following the law is right, even if it hurts.~
@1089 = ~You think it appropriate that Keldorn's wife now stays in prison?~
@1090 = ~Sir Keldorn knew that, too. He and Maria have my full sympathy... but there was no other solution before the law.~
@1091 = ~Considering that you are a follower of Helm, your words make me wonder, my lady.~
@1092 = ~I have a better solution: I'll travel and fight with him. Just like we do now, Ajantis.~
@1093 = ~Yes, considering the brave and powerful woman you are, that seems to be a suitable solution, for your husband and you, my lady.~
@1094 = ~I miss your attention, Ajantis. Please resume flirting with me.~
@1095 = ~Ajantis, I am scared that I will lose against evil without my soul.~
@1096 = ~It's happening, Ajantis: I am losing against evil. I'm scared!~
@1097 = ~Ajantis, if I ever lose control over these powers again, I want you to fight me. Slay me, if necessary. This is an order!~
@1098 = ~Ajantis, I don't want to hurt you while being the slayer. I don't want to kill you! Go, and leave me be. I would never forgive myself if I would hurt you again with my evil powers.~
@1099 = ~Love, do not lose faith in your strength! I am at your side.~
@1100 = ~Do not despond, love! The things that happen to you are terrible, and very frightening. Yet I know that you will succeed. You have to be strong!~
@1101 = ~Don't talk. Just take me into your arms and hold me tight for a moment, Ajantis.~
@1102 = ~Why do you always pretend to be sure that everything will end well? You said yourself that what's happening to me scares you!~
@1103 = ~You think, you know, you do. Could you actually care more for what bothers *me*?~
@1104 = ~Thank you for the encouragement. I guess it will be all right.~
@1105 = ~You can't convince me with that. I guess I just have to go on and keep searching for my soul.~
@1106 = ~I am here and will do anything required, anything at all, so it will be all right.~
@1107 = ~I... I am trying to give you confidence, love, to lessen your fear. If this is not what you need, then I don't know what else to do. I did not mean to put myself to the fore, love, not at all. To be there for you and fight for you is all I want, in the hope that it will take away your fears.~
@1108 = ~Of course I am scared! But on the same time I believe in your strength and willpower. You will not lose yourself, if you do not want to!~
@1109 = ~(Ajantis takes you into his arms, his hand stroking your hair. You can feel his tension.)~
@1110 = ~I...  (Moved, Ajantis takes you into his arms for a short embrace.) I will always stand beside you, love, and fight for you. For you, and against the evil inside you, if it becomes necessary. I will do it with Helm's aid! But if... if there is no other choice...~
@1111 = ~I will not let you down! I will never leave you, now that you need me more than ever.~
@1112 = ~I thank you, Ajantis. Your words reassure me.~
@1113 = ~Ajantis, I have decided. It is too dangerous for you to stay with me. Please, I do not want to see you in such danger!~
@1114 = ~May I decide anything myself?~
@1115 = ~Do not try to send me away again, love. My place is here at your side. This is where I want to be, and where I will stay!~
@1116 = ~No, I will not leave you alone. Love, please, do not ask this of me!~
@1117 = ~Ajantis, I am serious. I love you too much to put you into this danger. Please, go and put yourself into safety!~
@1118 = ~(Ajantis grips you on your shoulders.) Never! I will never leave you, love. Do you understand this?~
@1119 = ~(Ajantis embraces you tightly.) Never. Ask me for any favor, but not for this. I will not let you down! Now, no more words about this.~
@1120 = ~I am scared of the evil that is lurking inside me, Ajantis.~
@1121 = ~The good inside you is stronger than any evil, love. I know that.~
@1122 = ~Your goodness shines as a bright light that drives away any darkness, love.~
@1123 = ~You have a good heart. You will prevail!~
@1124 = ~(Ajantis takes you into his arms, for a short but loving embrace.) I love you, <CHARNAME>, and believe in you.~
@1125 = ~Do not despond, love! I am and will be at your side.~
@1126 = ~(You want to show your affection to Ajantis without words.)~
@1127 = ~(Ajantis' full attention is on you.)~
@1128 = ~I want you to protect me again, if I am deeply hurt in battle.~
@1129 = ~Ajantis, I must rely on you in battle. You will fight the opponent I send you to, independent of how much I am hurt.~
@1130 = ~I...  (turns white) I will always stand beside you, and fight for you. For you, and against the evil inside you, if it becomes necessary. I will do it with Helm's aid! But if... if there is no other choice, and if I am absolutely certain that I have lost you to the dark side, then... then I will kill you. Even if it will take all my strength to do so, my lady.~

/* ToB part */
@1131 = ~No time for idle talk. I am sure <CHARNAME> has a task for us.~
@1132 = ~So, our time of rest with the elves is over. Destiny has us again.~
@1133 = ~How is your family? Do you know?~
@1134 = ~Do you want to talk about something?~
@1135 = ~Any comments on recent events?~
@1136 = ~Nothing.~
@1137 = ~Thank you for your concern, <CHARNAME>, I appreciate it. They are fine... I think. Communication by letter is difficult in these times. But I have faith in my brothers of the Order who are guarding Waterdeep in these troubled times.~
@1138 = ~Seeing all these power-obsessed children of Bhaal, it is even more striking that you have managed to withstand the evil influence of your godly heritage, <CHARNAME>.~
@1139 = ~I am proud of how you withstand your evil heritage, love. By Helm!~
@1140 = ~You can trust in my full support in your fight. By Helm!~
@1141 = ~I hope Helm will forgive me... but if these are what the gods want us to believe as the different possible outcomes of your destiny, then I have to wonder.~
@1142 = ~Doubting your god?~
@1143 = ~It's needless to talk about this, Ajantis.~
@1144 = ~The solar showed us 'what-ifs', but she got it all wrong. You were never as selfish as the 'evil you' we fought recently. And you were never as helpless and uncertain as your 'doubt' wanted us to believe, either. It offered to 'restore' you to something you never were. That is what I meant.~
@1145 = ~The solar's revelation impressed me deeply.~
@1146 = ~It... it also eased my mind tremendously, love.~
@1147 = ~It is not your destiny to fulfil the prophesy, but to obstruct its completion!~
@1148 = ~I understand it now. You play a special role in these times. You will shape the future. You will define destiny, your own and that of many others. It is in your hands!~
@1149 = ~No pressure, huh?~
@1150 = ~I am glad the solar agrees. It was my plan all along.~
@1151 = ~I thought prophecies tell what *will* happen.~
@1152 = ~We will see.~
@1153 = ~Well, for a lot of enemies I already have defined their destinies, without a solar to tell me to.~
@1154 = ~It is up to you to end this chaos. I feel humbled and proud to be at your side. There I will remain and support you with all my might, as long as you stay on the path of righteousness.~
@1155 = ~Not necessarily. And for some, it always depends on how they are interpreted.~
@1156 = ~That you will be the one shaping our future gives me strength, love... My fears about the forces influencing our lives lessened considerably once I understood this.~
@1157 = ~I still have to think about the city of Saradush that fell in this war. We were too late to save them.~
@1158 = ~Yes, we were.~
@1159 = ~I can't talk about it, Ajantis. It was too much.~
@1160 = ~Oh, no. I won't take this on. I tried to save the city, and I am not guilty of their death. Yaga Shura is.~
@1161 = ~The... the whole city, and all inside... I guess Laran... the young paladin fought until the end...~
@1162 = ~Hopefully not all inhabitants. They must have managed to open an escape tunnel with the help they had from us?~
@1163 = ~Well, shit happens.~
@1164 = ~It was we who killed Gromnir. Without their leader, the city did not last as long as it could have.~
@1165 = ~Yes, we did, but I went to him in peace.~
@1166 = ~He attacked us, Ajantis. There was no arguing with him, you know that.~
@1167 = ~I don't know. Gromnir seemed to have lost touch with reality, paranoid as he was.~
@1168 = ~Nonsense. That fool Gromnir was completely out of his mind already. His presence wouldn't have changed anything.~
@1169 = ~Of course he is, and we tried our best.~
@1170 = ~We had a run of bad luck in our attempts to help the city.~
@1171 = ~As a paladin, it was his duty to defend the city, yes. I am sorry at the thought of the loss of such a young comrade.~
@1172 = ~You... you were very fond of him, Lady <CHARNAME>, were you not? I am sorry you lost a friend.~
@1173 = ~I hope so, too. But we won't know until we meet a refugee.~
@1174 = ~I know. I know it is not our fault. And yet, it feels like we failed. It will take a while for me to accept the way this ended.~
@1175 = ~He didn't give us a chance.~
@1176 = ~I wouldn't be so sure about it. The death of their leader discouraged the warriors, even if his presence would not have added greatly to their fighting prowess.~
@1177 = ~If that is all you have to say about it, then I am wasting my time talking to you.~
@1178 = ~I am sorry. I did not mean to distress you further, and will remain quiet. It will take a while for me to accept the way this ended, though.~
@1179 = ~But I... I understand now that you cannot run from your destiny, love. I will be here, at your side.~
@1180 = ~Indeed...~
@1181 = ~May I ask, <CHARNAME>, how you liked Suldanessellar? The elves showed great hospitality. Long will I remember the celebration that evening beneath rustling tree tops. It was... unfamiliar, yet very beautiful.~
@1182 = ~Yes, it was great, and peaceful.~
@1183 = ~Well, the tension showed in the end. Not even they could withdraw themselves from the influence of Alaundo's prophecies.~
@1184 = ~Hm, if you say so.~
@1185 = ~I stayed because they gave me free board and lodging and tended to my wounds, Ajantis. That's all.~
@1186 = ~You think so? I am glad to be out of there.~
@1187 = ~It's long passed, or at least it feels that way. I do not wish to talk about it.~
@1188 = ~Well, it's over, and with the current changes we won't ever be welcome there as we were.~
@1189 = ~I often thought of you while we were there.~
@1190 = ~You are of elven origin, yet raised by humans. Do you want to talk about it?~
@1191 = ~About what?~
@1192 = ~I didn't feel welcome in Suldanessellar, Ajantis.~
@1193 = ~I liked it there. I would have liked to stay longer in Suldanessellar.~
@1194 = ~No, I don't want to talk about it, Ajantis.~
@1195 = ~Do you not wonder yourself how it would have been, growing up there amongst your kin?~
@1196 = ~Yes, there are times when I ask myself that.~
@1197 = ~No, my home is Candlekeep.~
@1198 = ~Thank you for adding insult to injury, Ajantis.~
@1199 = ~I apologize for raising this topic, <CHARNAME>.~
@1200 = ~Oh. I did notice, but I somehow believed you would feel attached to the forest nonetheless.~
@1201 = ~Why would that be? Just because I am of elvish origin?~
@1202 = ~(wryly) To the forest maybe, but all those elves in there really were a distraction!~
@1203 = ~Yes, I liked the forest... (sigh)~
@1204 = ~Forgive me. It seems I am attributing too much influence to the forces that determine the elvish community.~
@1205 = ~You don't need to apologize. What did you want to ask me?~
@1206 = ~Indeed. We have talked enough about this topic.~
@1207 = ~I thought so.~
@1208 = ~Your fate led to your alienation from your mortal ancestors, but in combination with your godly heritage it is far more than that...~
@1209 = ~That is good to hear. Not everyone would be ready to accept fate this willingly.~
@1210 = ~Does the fact that events have prevented you from remaining with the elves fill you with regret, <CHARNAME>?~
@1211 = ~I might be of elven blood, Ajantis, but what happened showed that they would hardly accept me as one of their own.~
@1212 = ~Everything about me tells them I was not raised amongst them: my behavior, my way of moving, all that was shaped in my childhood in Candlekeep.~
@1213 = ~I am but a half-elf, Ajantis. In my experience, most humans see my elven heritage, whereas elves mostly see my human origin.~
@1214 = ~Maybe I will return there one day, when my quest is fulfilled...~
@1215 = ~I am not interested in returning to that place. The elven culture is alien to me.~
@1216 = ~I am not interested in returning to that place. The elven culture is alien to me, and the fact that I am no more than a child in years to them doesn't help.~
@1217 = ~Suldanessellar's elves were kind to me because we saved them. Had I stayed longer, problems would have arisen due to my 'other' heritage.~
@1218 = ~I don't want to talk about it!~
@1219 = ~Maybe you are right. In these times, many doors are closed to you due to your godly heritage.~
@1220 = ~I should stop pondering on the past and enjoy the company of this wonderful woman at my side.~
@1221 = ~Forgive me. I was uncertain whether you would like to talk about this. From your words I take it that it hurts you, indeed.~
@1222 = ~Indeed, but that is the way it is.~
@1223 = ~It's alright, I do wonder about it myself sometimes.~
@1224 = ~No, I was kidding. I spent my childhood in Candlekeep and that is my home.~
@1225 = ~I thank you for your concern, but let us end the conversation here.~
@1226 = ~You are the last person I wish to discuss this with, Ajantis.~
@1227 = ~Yes, that is the reason the thought preoccupied me. But forgive me for bringing up this topic. The question of 'what if' is idle if we have no power to interfere.~
@1228 = ~Do not get me wrong. I am thankful that you are as you are and that you are here, with me!~
@1229 = ~Did you feel unwelcome because of your origin? I am not referring to your Bhaal heritage or your childhood in Candlekeep. I am referring to your mother's race. As a <PRO_RACE>, you may have found the elves somewhat... less than tolerant, after all.~
@1230 = ~No, that was not a problem.~
@1231 = ~I was aware of that, but no-one in Suldanessellar behaved badly towards me.~
@1232 = ~Indeed, very well spotted. I felt very uncomfortable, and I am sure the frigid farewell was partly due to that. Surely they would have treated an elven child of Bhaal with greater warmth?~
@1233 = ~I am just relieved that we left, and do not wish to talk about this any more.~
@1234 = ~That is good to hear. It was not my impression that you were maltreated because of your origin. Very well do the elves know how you were raised.~
@1235 = ~We will never know, I fear. But I do believe the reasons they told us before our departure were not invented.~
@1236 = ~Well, it is rather idle conversation, pondering about things that are in the past and cannot be changed.~
@1237 = ~A blue dragon! The thought of you and this creature sharing the same godly father is hardly believable.~
@1238 = ~Yes, I guess a family reunion with my 'kin' would be an impressive event even in peaceful times.~
@1239 = ~I don't see these murdering monsters as my siblings, Ajantis.~
@1240 = ~It's hard to imagine, indeed.~
@1241 = ~Well, nothing like this surprises me any more, not really. Not after the Bhaal children we met recently. (cough)~
@1242 = ~What is so hard to imagine? Bhaal was a god, after all.~
@1243 = ~(sigh) Are you about to give another lecture on how the true colors of my godly heritage frighten you?~
@1244 = ~It's not worth thinking about it, Ajantis.~
@1245 = ~Of course they are not your siblings, not in the usual sense. I am aware of that. The essence of a god is not bound to normal heredity rules.~
@1246 = ~Surprising to see how self-important the son was about his father's heritage, though, considering he didn't share in it.~
@1247 = ~Well, not by carrying it himself, but in some ways he did, so to say.~
@1248 = ~I am surprised enough to see he had a full-grown son! It shows how long Bhaal tarried amongst mortals. That, or the whole thing didn't go by normal rules.~
@1249 = ~No, I was not about to give you such a speech. It seems I am saying this quite often lately, does it not?... No, I was pondering on the connection between all of Bhaal's children, arising from their shared godly heritage.~
@1250 = ~If you think so.~
@1251 = ~It was impressive enough to see all the assembled children of Bhaal in Saradush, and those were mostly humanoid ones.~
@1252 = ~You are right. Plus, a misled mind always finds a reason.~
@1253 = ~The ways of the gods are sometimes difficult to understand for us mortals.~
@1254 = ~I am startled to see a dragon with Bhaal heritage, although I know it is a naive thing to say. But Abazigal was by far the mightiest Bhaal child I have encountered.~
@1255 = ~But what am I saying. Not the blue dragon, but you! You are the mightiest, and presumably the most impressive child of Bhaal, if I may say so.~
@1256 = ~Yes, my love?~
@1257 = ~I am so happy to have you. What would I do without you, Ajantis!~
@1258 = ~Maybe Helm will grant you the mercy, while defending me... What?~
@1259 = ~Do you really have to send the shield back to your family?~
@1260 = ~I am thinking about our wedding...~
@1261 = ~(impishly) We could marry here, you know. Maybe, if I concentrate enough, a small side chapel with a skull-laden altar might appear...~
@1262 = ~We cannot marry under these circumstances. We have to wait for quieter times.~
@1263 = ~Do you still think of your family? You don't talk about it, but I know that you miss your parents.~
@1264 = ~Do you still keep in touch with your family in Waterdeep, Ajantis? Even though your parents disowned you because of our relationship, I am sure you want to know how they are doing.~
@1265 = ~Ajantis, you know I need you, yes? You give me the strength I need in these frightening times.~
@1266 = ~I love you, Ajantis.~
@1267 = ~Are you all right?~
@1268 = ~Cyric! Cyric appeared... A god came and threatened you, personally.~
@1269 = ~At least I assume he threatened... But he couldn't do anything, could he? He has to wait for the outcome of this, as we all do. Because you are the one who will decide it, and that is true on so many levels.~
@1270 = ~Being just as smart, wonderful, and beautiful as you are now, I am sure!~
@1271 = ~Thank you, Ajantis.~
@1272 = ~Oh, come on! Don't you know a compliment when you see one?~
@1273 = ~I do, my love, and I thank you for your declaration of appreciation. But I still believe what I said. All your strength and everything you are comes from within you, independent of my presence.~
@1274 = ~Only stating the truth. (smiles)~
@1275 = ~<CHARNAME>, do you remember how I came to your aid in battle and we talked about it?~
@1276 = ~Of course, I am not suffering from memory loss.~
@1277 = ~What is it?~
@1278 = ~I was certain it was the right thing to do. I swore to protect you, to keep you from harm, so I turned against the enemy that was putting your life in danger.~
@1279 = ~It took me until now to realize that by doing so, I disobeyed an order - your fighting order, love. (hesitates) It is confusing.~
@1280 = ~I liked it very much, Ajantis. I saw that you did it to protect me.~
@1281 = ~Ajantis, don't think about it. I also expect you to defend yourself against the enemy that causes you the most damage, no matter which enemy I sent you to.~
@1282 = ~As long as the enemies are defeated I don't care.~
@1283 = ~I understand you meant it well, but indeed I was displeased by you not obeying my order.~
@1284 = ~I didn't like it, Ajantis, and what you said is one reason why.~
@1285 = ~I told you not to do that and I had my reasons.~
@1286 = ~Did it take you until now to notice that?!~
@1287 = ~You are my wife. To protect you is my duty.~
@1288 = ~You are my betrothed. To protect you is my duty.~
@1289 = ~Since you are also my leader, it is my duty to obey your orders. I also have to protect you as my leader, but as such, you have the power to order me not to do so.~
@1290 = ~So, do I fulfil my duty if I disregard your fighting order to come to your aid?~
@1291 = ~Yes, absolutely.~
@1292 = ~I am not sure. This is complicated.~
@1293 = ~No, not at all. An order is an order.~
@1294 = ~I think I do, assuming that you were incapable of giving orders at that time. Recall the situation: would you have called for my aid?~
@1295 = ~I was about to do it anyway, yes.~
@1296 = ~Yes, but as you said, I was too occupied dying to do so.~
@1297 = ~If at all, I would call for help that is nearer by.~
@1298 = ~No, I wouldn't and I have my reasons.~
@1299 = ~I don't recall the situation, Ajantis.~
@1300 = ~I assumed you were too weak to call for help. I would never disobey your orders, love, never. Also I would not hesitate to turn against you if I saw the slightest spark of evil rising in you, and you know that.~
@1301 = ~But letting you die... Letting you die in the heat of an enemy attack is something completely different.~
@1302 = ~I understand your turmoil. As I said, it was alright.~
@1303 = ~Why do you assume I would have died? It is this assumption you base the justification of your disobedience on. Maybe it is wrong.~
@1304 = ~So I live on with the knowledge that my husband doesn't respect my leadership. Thanks a lot.~
@1305 = ~So I live on with the knowledge that my betrothed doesn't respect my leadership. Thanks a lot.~
@1306 = ~What? No, this is absolutely not true, love. Please! If you listened to what I just said, you surely understand?~
@1307 = ~A turmoil this is. What shall I do in the future?~
@1308 = ~Come to my aid.~
@1309 = ~Now that I know your motivation, I want you to come to my aid.~
@1310 = ~Do as you think is necessary.~
@1311 = ~Don't change the fighting order unless I tell you to.~
@1312 = ~I told you already I don't want you to change enemies unless I tell you to.~
@1313 = ~So be it, then.~
@1314 = ~To realize I might have neglected my duty as I came to your aid... (sigh) I am still confused. At least I know now how you think about it. I think I can handle this situation in the future.~
@1315 = ~Love, the shield belongs to the Ilvastarr family... And they decided to deny me the honor of having their name. Yes, it has to be. That is all I want to say about it.~
@1316 = ~(Ajantis looks at you for a moment.) Love, those were silly words...~
@1317 = ~I... I wanted to say: Maybe Helm will grant me the mercy to fall while defending you... Saving me the pain of enduring the loneliness that would come, without you.~
@1318 = ~Those were my thoughts, but I rejected them even before they were completely formed in my head. I would never allow this to happen, I swear this to you. Never!~
@1319 = ~(You take Ajantis in your arms.)~
@1320 = ~Ajantis, we will make it.~
@1321 = ~I surely hope so!~
@1322 = ~I thank you for your comfort. (deep sigh) Thank you, that did me good.~
@1323 = ~I know you believe in those words.~
@1324 = ~And that you can. I will never neglect my duties. And to stay alive I see as a duty, love... As long as I can prevent my death.~
@1325 = ~I thank you, love. Thank you for these words. They mean a lot to me.~
@1326 = ~I hear you, love, but... I thank you. I know you mean it.~
@1327 = ~(takes a deep breath) Thank you, love. Your reassurance means a lot to me.~
@1328 = ~I'll be here for you, love. With all my might... with all my power, little as it may be.~
@1329 = ~As much as I can, knowing that my beloved is the one Alaundo's prophecies speak of... Forgive me, but this *is* overwhelming.~
@1330 = ~I understand completely, love. There is no need to discuss it any further.~
@1331 = ~(shocked) Love, please!~
@1332 = ~(exhales) You meant to provoke me... and by Helm, you succeeded!~
@1333 = ~If we were free to marry now, how would you like it to be?~
@1334 = ~I want a big wedding, with dancing and music, and a feast, and everyone in their finest gowns.~
@1335 = ~Nothing fancy. Just you and me, and maybe a few of our dearest friends.~
@1336 = ~Why can't we marry now? There is a temple nearby.~
@1337 = ~Why can't we marry now? This is a temple, after all.~
@1338 = ~Why can't we marry now? We've got a cleric right here.~
@1339 = ~Can we not just live together without any kind of formal ceremony?~
@1340 = ~We can't be married now, so there is no point in talking about it.~
@1341 = ~(smiles) Gowns? You'll let me wear breeches, I hope.~
@1342 = ~You deserve something stately, but if that is what you want, that is what you shall have.~
@1343 = ~I am a paladin, love. I would prefer a solemn oath to bind us.~
@1344 = ~That is true, unfortunately.~
@1345 = ~I hope it will come true one day. Until then we have to face what destiny puts in our way.~
@1346 = ~Here? Amid all this fighting and misery? No, love. We have to help these people, and fast. Once this trial has been overcome, we can enter a temple to give our oaths.~
@1347 = ~Here? By no means will I swear such a solemn oath in this enclave of hell, love. But even if we left this place...~
@1348 = ~I know we have a cleric, but a wedding is a far more solemn ceremony than can be performed on a dusty road in between our enemies' attacks.~
@1349 = ~That is a sensible question, love... officially, I should ask 'what parents', but I cannot. They still are and will ever be, and you are right, I think of them.~
@1350 = ~Think of and... and miss them. I know they are in the past, but like every man and woman I have times when I think back on those glorious childhood moments when everything seemed to be good.~
@1351 = ~I thank you for your concern, but I am all right. I have chosen well, love, and for everything I lost, I gained much more.~
@1352 = ~You know I always wrote letters to my family, even if my duties as a paladin left me but little time. You are my family now, but surely it does not surprise you to hear me confess that I did not cease contact with my sister entirely...~
@1353 = ~My letters to her are not as frequent and numerous as they were to my parents in earlier days. During the events of the past weeks I wrote even less. But now there is an additional problem that complicates our communication: with your powers of the pocket plane, it is almost unforeseeable where we will be each day, and some of the places we visit are far apart. Since we are located in no one place but find ourselves here today and elsewhere tomorrow, she has no address where she can send the letters and I can receive them in a decent amount of time...~
@1354 = ~Do you wish us to visit one place frequently so it can serve as your home base in terms of letters from Waterdeep?~
@1355 = ~You could tell her to address the letters to: c/o <CHARNAME>, Child of Bhaal, Pocket Plane, Hell.~
@1356 = ~That sounds inconvenient, yes.~
@1357 = ~I am sure you will manage quite a while without a letter.~
@1358 = ~I am not sure... Neglecting our duties for this is no option. The letters will reach me when times have quieted down and fate no longer leads us to places far distant. And...~
@1359 = ~...very funny, love.~
@1360 = ~Of course, but it is displeasing not to know.~
@1361 = ~I have to confess I am uneasy about reading letters from my sister. What would they tell me? I am burning with fear for my relatives' safety and the question of whether war has reached them yet.~
@1362 = ~But my parents' reproaches concerning our relationship, their fear, knowing me to be at the side of a child of Bhaal... I do not want to read about those. (sigh)~
@1363 = ~But still, I cannot help but think. With the war going on now, I wonder how they are doing. How is Waterdeep handling the situation? Are they in danger? Do they curse you, and me, for whatever is happening to them right now?~
@1364 = ~These... these are just thoughts, <CHARNAME>. They might occupy me for a while, but they do not overwhelm me completely. Do not worry about my fighting abilities, they are not diminished.~
@1365 = ~Stop talking about your fighting abilities. If you are troubled, I want to know because I care.~
@1366 = ~I am sorry it troubles you. It is a naive thought that it might trouble you less because they cast you out. They are still your parents.~
@1367 = ~You have to free your mind from whatever they might be thinking.~
@1368 = ~This they are, although they do no longer call me their son. (sigh)~
@1369 = ~I thank you, love.~
@1370 = ~I... I have to see them again, one day. When all this is finished, I will go to Waterdeep again, and seek their understanding of the wife I chose.~
@1371 = ~I will not seek their forgiveness, as I have done nothing wrong. But we have talked about it long enough.~
@1372 = ~But you are right. I will try and send a letter soon. I know some of them still want to know about my well-being, I am sure. It would be cruel not to let them know.~
@1373 = ~I know, but I cannot. I can only suppress these thoughts.~
@1374 = ~Let me help you ease the tension, Ajantis.~
@1375 = ~Do not mind me, love. I am alright.~
@1376 = ~(sigh) You got me. I... I manage. That is more truthful.~
@1377 = ~Yes, I would appreciate that, very much. Maybe you could massage my shoulders when we rest next? I thank you.~
@1378 = ~We should focus on the important things at hand, love. Do not worry about me.~
@1379 = ~Ah, how about a hot cup of tea, in a comfortable chair? The fire not too hot - I have no need for more heat, not in these realms. A nice thought.~
@1380 = ~You, turning to me, saying this to me, looking at me the way you do now, gives me all the comfort I need, love. I thank you.~
@1381 = ~Let me see your smile, love, with that sparkle in your eyes - and I will forget for just a second where we are, and what is awaiting us.~
@1382 = ~(takes a deep breath) Thank you, love. I appreciate it.~
@1383 = ~Please, yes. Another massage, if we find the time.~
@1384 = ~Just let me... (Ajantis puts his hand behind your neck, drawing his face to your hair.) Having you near me, smelling your hair... all sorrows are forgotten. (He kisses you on the forehead, then lets you go.)~
@1385 = ~I am not turning evil! What are you talking about?~
@1386 = ~Yes, I want the godly throne. Why does this make me evil?~
@1387 = ~So, I am a lost cause, turning to evil, eh? Why are you still here?~
@1388 = ~Do not disturb my thoughts, <CHARNAME>. Do not disturb my concentration, as I have to meditate and seek Helm's guidance in these worrying times.~
@1389 = ~No matter what is happening with me, there is no need to talk about it.~
@1390 = ~Don't you feel it yourself? Don't you see it? Your behavior towards the solar - it is shaped with the haughtiness of a godspawn who is about to claim <PRO_HISHER> heritage.~
@1391 = ~Striving for Bhaal's powers - believing them to be yours - takes you on a path of corruption, even though your alignment is not evil.~
@1392 = ~Because they are evil divine powers, <CHARNAME>.~
@1393 = ~Maybe I am wrong... Maybe I am oversensitive...~
@1394 = ~I don't want to be corrupted! I didn't even notice it happening!~
@1395 = ~Any advice?~
@1396 = ~I am who I am, Ajantis. You'll have to live with it.~
@1397 = ~Be humble, <CHARNAME>. Be humble and let the solar teach you about your past. Bethink yourself of what is good and righteous, and align your words and actions with it!~
@1398 = ~This answer does not give me much hope. (sigh)~
@1399 = ~I will be here, fighting at your side, as long as you want me to.~
@1400 = ~As I said, <CHARNAME>, it is a silent transformation...~
@1401 = ~I don't know what to say any more, <CHARNAME>... Only this:~
@1402 = ~Here I am, seeing you on what I believe is a path of corruption... At the same time knowing that you are - still - serving a greater good, and it is my duty to help you and fight at your side. (sigh)~
@1403 = ~So, let us continue to play what the gods laid out for us.~
@1404 = ~I... I can feel it, Ajantis. You are right, something happened to me.~
@1405 = ~I can't bear that look you give me any more - fear, not loving trust. Let us end our bond, I release you from it. I should have done so long ago!~
@1406 = ~Fear in my eyes? If you want to take on your father's throne, you will have to get used to seeing fear in people's eyes!~
@1407 = ~Forgive me, love... No, it is not that easy. We made vows... I will support you until the end. This is what my duty requires, and it is what the gods set out for us.~
@1408 = ~So, what now?~
@1409 = ~It happened, no need to talk about it further.~
@1410 = ~And, <CHARNAME>... I still have hope you will come back. I love you... I love you so much my heart is aching!~
@1411 = ~Did you really have to send the shield back to your family?~
@1412 = ~Love, the shield belongs to the Ilvastarr family... And they decided to deny me the honor of having their name. Yes, it had to be. That is all I want to say about it.~

@1413 = ~I... am not entirely sure. From the Order I heard about an asylum on a far away island, where dangerous and criminal mages are being brought to.~ 
@1414 = ~Where do the Cowled Wizards bring the mages they arrest, Ajantis?~
@1415 = ~Can the Order of the Radiant Heart help us in any way to get to this place where they took Imoen and Irenicus?~
@1416 = ~<CHARNAME>, I am... sorry to point this out, but it might well be Imoen broke the law, and was arrested for it. The Order cannot interfere in the affairs of the Cowled Wizards.~
@1417 = ~But Imoen *is* innocent, Ajantis. She was defending us, that's all!~
@1418 = ~Still, they could have given her a mere warning. How were we supposed to know the rules?!~
@1419 = ~She was just frightened. It was Irenicus who forced them to take her with us. It was not fair, Ajantis. Admit it!~
@1420 = ~Then I'm saying that I want to go there to clear things up, nothing more. To 'have a look'. Surely your Order can't have anything against that!~
@1421 = ~I see your point, although it troubles me.~
@1422 = ~(sigh) Of course not.~
@1423 = ~Then let us go and find her, and set things right. The sooner, the better!~
@1424 = ~There will be no help from the Order, I am afraid. As I said, officially, the Cowled Wizards enforced their law and rightfully so. I am sorry.~

@1425 = ~I see that you have my letters. They have finally reached you, and before I did after all... Well, then you know already that I did not reach my parents in Waterdeep before I was recalled by the Order. The tensions in the Sword Coast made many missions for the Order necessary.~

@1426 = ~(Knowing that he needs more time to come to terms with his parents' refusal, you leave him alone.)~
@1427 = ~(Knowing what troubles him, you give him a wordless gesture of reassurance.)~
@1428 = ~What are you thinking, Ajantis? I see your pain and it troubles me. Please, talk to me.~
@1429 = ~(You know that your gesture was understood when Ajantis gives you a faint smile. You see a glint of gratefulness in his eyes, before it is again overcome by sadness and worry.)~
@1430 = ~(Unlike so often, Ajantis instantly takes you in his arms, in a strong, comforting embrace.)~
@1431 = ~(When you part, you have the impression of tears in his eyes, but he turns away too quickly to be sure.)~
@1432 = ~(He holds you just a little longer than usual, and you gain the impression that he needed this hug not less than you.)~
@1433 = ~(When you part, his face is stern and unreadable.) Let us move on, love.~

@1434 = ~I... I would be devastated would I have to believe you died by my hands, my lady!~

@1435 = ~I hope you can accustom yourself to the idea of getting your wedding ring there, because I do not know where else we could get such high quality.~

@1436 = ~Now that we are together again, we can concern ourselves with the selection of the ring in peace.~
@1437 = ~We will have to worry about the selection of the ring another time, just as our wedding will probably be delayed.~


@1438 = ~I will send them to a goldsmith at the earliest opportunity.~

@1439 = ~I will support you with all my might. Stay on the path of good and righteous, and your evil heritage will not take over!~

@1440 = ~If I am absolutely certain that I have lost you to the dark side, then... then I will kill you. Even if it will break my heart.~

@1441 = ~And... because you now have enough space to stow things in, I do not need to feel guilty if I give you further jewelry... If our obligations permit, of course.~

@1442 = ~Let us move on, I do not want to talk more about it.~

@1443 = ~I misplaced my engagement ring, Ajantis, but I am very sorry about it. (sigh) It would have been taken by Irenicus' thugs, anyway, I guess.~

@1444 = ~This is unfortunate. But do not grieve, beloved. I will have a new, untainted ring forged for you, so that it may once more grace your delicate finger.~

@1445 = ~How do you cope with having to return the Ilvastarr family shield? I am furious they did this to you!~
@1446 = ~Do not worry, love. I manage.~
@1447 = ~(Ajantis gives you a smile.) Thank you for asking, love.~
@1448 = ~(sigh) It is all very overwhelming.~
@1449 = ~With you at my side, always.~
@1450 = ~I am tense, but I am alright.~

/* new for v20 */
@1451  = ~When we are ready, we should go and confront Irenicus, to stop him being a threat to you - and everyone else he might try to hurt.~
@1452 = ~Can the Order of the Radiant Heart help us in any way to get to this place where they took Irenicus?~
