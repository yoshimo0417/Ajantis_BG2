@0    = ~<CHARNAME>, we did it! We managed to defeat this spawn of hell with our combined forces, and I feel as if a great weight has been taken off of my soul. I thank you on behalf of the Order for this heroic deed.~ [c#ablank]
@1    = ~I wish to inform the Order as soon as possible of this fortunate turn of events. Let us travel quickly to Athkatla!~
@2    = ~<CHARNAME>, you've done it! You managed to defeat this spawn of hell! I cannot help but feel as if a great weight has been taken off of my soul. I thank you on behalf of the Order for this heroic deed.~ [c#ablank]
@3    = ~<CHARNAME>, please let us travel to the headquarters of the Order, so that my comrades can learn of this beast's death.~
@4    = ~<CHARNAME>, I trust that you will take your duty to the Order seriously and destroy this dragon, which Firkraag turned out to be. I will aid you with all of my power in this, and I hope that we shall face the creature soon.~ [c#ablank]
@5    = ~Yes, you are right. Let us prepare, and face this dragon in battle.~
@6    = ~I told you from the very start that Firkraag is not my top priority, Ajantis.~
@7    = ~Ajantis, you have my word that we shall destroy this Firkraag. Right now is simply not the proper time. Rest assured that we shall do it as soon as possible, though.~
@8    = ~Ajantis, I'm planning to do so... but not right now!~
@9    = ~You left taking revenge on Firkraag to me, and it's for me alone to decide if I shall face him and when I will do so.~
@10   = ~I'm content with your answer, <CHARNAME>. You should know that this means a lot to me.~
@11   = ~(sigh) I will settle for this answer, <CHARNAME>. You should know that this means a lot to me.~
@12   = ~<CHARNAME>! Garren Windspear's child remains in the clutches of evil. He needs our aid, and the Order looks to you for help!~ [c#ablank]
@13   = ~I already have the key. Just a little longer, and Garren's child will be free.~
@14   = ~We're searching in the right place, Ajantis. Firkraag keeps Garren's child imprisoned here, and we shall free him as soon as we know how.~
@15   = ~You should know me better than to cast doubt on my motives! Of course we will release Garren's son as soon as possible.~
@16   = ~We will release Garren's child at the earliest opportunity.~
@17   = ~I'm absolutely aware of your opinion in this matter. Keep quiet; your constant complaining doesn't help at all.~
@18   = ~This is the only proper answer. Let us set about it instantly!~
@19   = ~You should make sure that it happens soon, <CHARNAME>. Your jauntiness is inappropriate and completely out of place!~
@20   = ~<CHARNAME>, you accepted the offer of this... bandit to run your own thieves guild?! You, the light of my heart, the leader of a pack of thieves?! I don't know what to say!~ [c#ablank]
@21   = ~I feared you would have a bit of a problem with my decision. Can't you look on the bright side of it all? How we might gain from this?~
@22   = ~Then simply keep quiet. How I wish to earn my money is my own affair.~
@23   = ~No, I don't see this bright side you speak of. You, ally with this scum... what about your path of goodness and righteousness? What has become of it, <CHARNAME>? How can you team up with such people without betraying yourself, without betraying... us?!~
@24   = ~It doesn't have to end this way. Open your eyes to the possibilities this might offer! What makes you believe I will sink to the same level as murderers and criminals?~
@25   = ~Ajantis, my decision is final. I will use the guild as a way to effect the proceedings of this town, not for my own personal benefit. You do the same thing, the only difference is that you do so by means of your Order, and I shall do so from the shady side streets. It's not as bad as you think!~
@26   = ~You, you, you, always only you and your Order! My decision is made, and if it doesn't suit your plans, I cannot help you!~
@27   = ~You truly think so? You're obliged to a paladin of Helm, <CHARNAME>. What applies to me has to apply to you as well, otherwise our attachment is invalid!~
@28   = ~Ajantis, no! Please, I don't want us to come apart this way.~
@29   = ~Then it must be invalid. I don't know what to say, but you may leave if you wish. You will only hinder me if you are going to be like this.~
@30   = ~Ajantis, no! Please, it just can't be that we come apart like this. We pledged our troth - until the end of all times!~
@31   = ~Because you will be working with murderers and criminals, and you want to be the leader. <CHARNAME>, this is another turn of the screw! You're obliged to a paladin of Helm, <CHARNAME>. What applies to me has to apply to you as well, otherwise our attachment is invalid!~
@32   = ~There's great naivety in your words. Do you think you could last in the world of crime? I wish you had declined that offer, but it's too late now. <CHARNAME>, you're obliged to a paladin of Helm. What applies to me has to apply to you as well, otherwise our attachment is invalid!~
@33   = ~Ajantis, no! Please, we must not come apart this way.~
@34   = ~I wish it was different, but your decision is definitive. You have chosen the dark side... (groan) I have no option but to keep an eye on your dealings as a guild leader on behalf of the Order.~
@35   = ~Our engagement is broken herewith.~
@36   = ~I assumed that much. I know your principles well enough to know that it was your last word on the subject.~
@37   = ~Ajantis, please, I... Is there no other way?~
@38   = ~Your blockheadedness knows no limits! It's just unbelievable. Leave, for all I care, you're just hindering me.~
@39   = ~But this... this is impossible. No, it mustn't be! I've sworn fidelity to you, beloved! We tied the knot. What... what shall we do now?~
@40   = ~Ajantis, I've been stupid... but I'm not base. Please help me emerge from this situation!~
@41   = ~Oh, well, I don't care a copper. I suppose you may leave if you wish. You will only hinder me if you are going to be like this.~
@42   = ~So... So shall it be, then. I will return to the Order to collect myself...~
@43   = ~So shall it be then. <CHARNAME>, nothing more keeps me in this group now. Excuse me. I will return to the Order to collect myself.~
@44   = ~<CHARNAME>, I am supposed to support you in what you do, and I would be willing to do so... As a comrade-in-arms, if you still need me.~
@45   = ~Would you? Yes, then stay with us as a mere traveling companion.~
@46   = ~Ha. You rambled about my 'treading the dark path' only a moment ago, and now you're offering your service as a paladin?~
@47   = ~No, I won't put up with that. Leave: you're just hindering me.~
@48   = ~So shall it be then. I shall continue to support you as long as your deeds are consistent with my duties. You should know, however, that I will keep a close watch on your Shadow Thieves activities.~
@49   = ~I shall continue to support you as long as your deeds are consistent with my duties.~
@50   = ~So shall it be then. You should know, however, that I will keep a close watch on your Shadow Thieves activities.~
@51   = ~I... I cannot see one, beloved. You have made your decision.~
@52   = ~Ajantis, I've been stupid... but I'm not base. Please help me emerge from this situation!~
@53   = ~That... that means that we can't stay together anymore, <CHARNAME>. I don't have a choice. To continue on with you as my wife would mean to betray my duties as a knight. Our union is concluded for a lifetime, <CHARNAME>... I shall leave and pray for mercy, so that Helm may forgive me. Fare... Farewell.~
@54   = ~I can't, <CHARNAME>. What do you expect of me?~
@55   = ~Your blockheadedness knows no limits! This is just unbelievable. Leave, for all I care. You're just hindering me if you are going to be like this.~
@56   = ~<CHARNAME>, I see the amulet of the priestess of Talos in our baggage. I will not tolerate this thievery! Even if Talos's tenets are more than damnable, shall we commit this wicked deed simply to get in the good graces of thieves?! I assume you will return it.~ [c#ablank]
@57   = ~What do you suggest we should do instead of stealing this amulet?~
@58   = ~Ajantis, how shall I earn Mae'Var's trust then?~
@59   = ~I intend to complete this task, and I won't put up with your constant interference with my affairs.~
@60   = ~There must be another, less larcenous, way. The proof we need for the Shadow Thieves can be found somewhere in Mae'Var's guild house, I am sure of it. Let us search for it without playing handymen for these villainous people!~
@61   = ~Hm. You're right. Why am I bullied around by this scum? I shall do as you say, Ajantis.~
@62   = ~Do you really suggest we should rouse the whole thieves' nest and most likely kill them all in the process?! We might procure the proof, but I doubt that Renal will bubble over with joy. He insinuated that we should act discreetly.~
@63   = ~This course of action spells a fight, and whether we would find the proof or not is doubtful. No, I will commit the theft Mae'Var demanded.~
@64   = ~I am relieved to hear that. I could not support conduct such as that. Then let us return the amulet.~
@65   = ~I do not care about what this criminal might think! You've been desperate to work for Renal, and I am grateful for the insight into the Shadow Thieves guild. But I will not wend a spurious way, and I expect the same of you!~
@66   = ~What do you suggest we shall do instead of stealing this amulet?~
@67   = ~You think we should demand the proof straight from the horse's mouth? Perhaps you're right. Why am I bullied around by this scum? I shall do as you say, Ajantis.~
@68   = ~Ajantis, I intend to complete this task, and I won't put up with you constantly interfering with my affairs.~
@69   = ~Then I cannot continue to support your actions. I won't bring you to account here and now, for I still have some respect for you. You will find me in the Order's headquarters should you need me again.~
@70   = ~I hear your words with disbelief, beloved. Can't you see that this is wrong? Are you sure of it? Then... then I can't go on supporting you.~
@71   = ~No, Ajantis, I don't want you to leave. That would mean the end of our engagement, wouldn't it? I shall do as you say and won't commit that theft.~
@72   = ~No, Ajantis, I don't want you to leave. We are married, after all! I shall do as you say and won't commit that theft.~
@73   = ~So shall it be, then. Leave. You're just hindering anyway.~
@74   = ~You would betray the bond between us for the sake of these criminals?! My love, what happened to you?~
@75   = ~Ajantis, no! Of course I wouldn't. I shall do as you say and won't commit the theft.~
@76   = ~I just changed, Ajantis. Leave. Your constant sermons are hindering.~
@77   = ~<CHARNAME>, we shall steal from the temple of Lathander... simply to get into the good graces of a group of thieves?! Explain yourself, for I cannot believe what has become of you.~ [c#ablank]
@78   = ~What do you mean?~
@79   = ~Ajantis, I am not keen on this myself, but we need Mae'Var's trust to procure the proof of his treachery. I want to use every opportunity to raise the gold we need for Imoen's rescue.~
@80   = ~I do this to find Irenicus, who tortured me and killed my friends. The Shadow Thieves have proven friendly so far, and I don't want to let them down. The temple of Lathander will get over the thievery.~
@81   = ~'What has become of me'? What is that supposed to mean?~
@82   = ~I haven't forgotten the goal we are trying to achieve, but the end doesn't justify the means, <CHARNAME>.~
@83   = ~But I want to do it, Ajantis.~
@84   = ~Saying so is easy. And what shall I do instead, pray tell?~
@85   = ~Hm. There might be a chance indeed. I shall do as you say, Ajantis.~
@86   = ~This course of action spells a fight, and whether we'd find the proof is doubtful. No, I will commit the theft Mae'Var demanded.~
@87   = ~I'm relieved to hear that. I couldn't support any other conduct.~
@88   = ~I'm glad to have your support furthermore, even if our path takes a turn you didn't exactly imagine.~
@89   = ~Yes, let us go.~
@90   = ~Fine. But what is 'what has become of me' supposed to mean?~
@91   = ~(sigh) My heart will break if the light of goodness and righteousness does not shine on you again soon, like it did in those days on the Sword Coast. I am afraid that due to my duties as a paladin, I cannot put up with our actions much longer, beloved!~
@92   = ~Then... then I cannot go along with you on this path any longer, my love.~
@93   = ~No, Ajantis, I don't want you to leave. We are married, after all! I shall do as you say and won't commit the theft.~
@94   = ~So... So shall it be then. Herewith our engagement is broken. I will return to the Order to collect myself...~
@95   = ~I may rejoin your party if I begin hearing news of your good deeds again. You were a maintainer of righteousness once... and I owe you my life... Farewell.~
@96   = ~You have been the light of my heart, and I owe you my life... Farewell.~
@97   = ~Your actions cast a slur on you, beloved. I expect you to change this as soon as possible.~
@98   = ~I'm not happy about it myself, Ajantis. But what exactly is your problem with Mae'Var's task?~
@99   = ~Oh, you are constantly whining... It seems like the only times we talk lately are when you preach at me.~
@100  = ~I have no other choice, <CHARNAME>. I'm a paladin and therefore bound by honor!~
@101  = ~(sigh) I know. I'm not happy about how things are working out, either. What's your suggestion regarding Mae'Var's errand?~
@102  = ~I'm tired of hearing this. Getting involved with you was a mistake. Leave, you're just hindering me as it is.~
@103  = ~What are you doing, my love?! You promised not to steal from the temple of Lathander, but now I see their statuette in our baggage. Well, I hope you just wanted to 'take a peek' at it. Do not try to leave the temple along with it. I won't tolerate this theft!~ [c#ablank]
@104  = ~What are you doing, <CHARNAME>? Do not tell me you are about to steal from the temple? I see their statuette in our baggage. Well, I hope you just wanted to 'take a peek' at it. Do not try to leave the temple along with it. I won't tolerate this theft!~ [c#ablank]
@105  = ~Beloved, you promised not to fulfill Mae'Var's infamous request, but now I catch you accomplishing the very same thing!~ [c#ablank]
@106  = ~Oh, my! I knew I had forgotten something. I didn't want to steal from Lathander's temple, Ajantis. I quite honestly forgot to put the statuette back!~
@107  = ~Oh, my! I knew I had forgotten something. I didn't want to steal from Talos' temple, Ajantis. I quite honestly forgot to put the amulet back!~
@108  = ~Well, I've changed my mind, Ajantis. I'll be doing as Mae'Var asks.~
@109  = ~What do you care?! Why must I vindicate myself all the time?!~
@110  = ~Well, I've changed my mind, Ajantis. I'll be doing as Mae'Var asks. I don't care about your opinion.~
@111  = ~What have you done, my love?! You wish to follow Mae'Var's nefarious request, to make yourself a thug's handmaid?!~ [c#ablank]
@112  = ~Well, I do what seems right to me, Ajantis.  I will work for Mae'Var.~
@113  = ~<CHARNAME>, I expected that you wouldn't follow Mae'Var's nefarious request, but now I catch you accomplishing the very same thing! I cannot continue to support your actions. I won't bring you to account here and now, for I still have some respect for you, but I will return to the Order.~ [c#ablank]
@114  = ~You made common cause with this blackguard, and you lied to me. There's just one way to respond to this, <CHARNAME>. Our engagement is broken herewith. I will return to the Order to collect myself...~
@115  = ~I'm a paladin of Helm, beloved! Whatever did you think? I expect righteous demeanor from you, just like from myself!~
@116  = ~You want me to believe this? You... you *are* a maintainer of righteousness, but the loss of your soul weakened you considerably. I believe you, but you have committed a theft, <CHARNAME>. What shall we do?~
@117  = ~Could we not just put it back?~
@118  = ~Well, I've changed my mind, Ajantis. It's good the way it is.~
@119  = ~No, it's not that simple, <CHARNAME>. Stealing is a crime, and you'll have to bear the consequences.~
@120  = ~You made common cause with this blackguard. There's just one way to respond to this, <CHARNAME>.~
@121  = ~You... you wish to break our engagement and abandon me?~
@122  = ~Just leave: you're hindering me, anyway.~
@123  = ~But this... this is impossible. No, it mustn't be! I have sworn fidelity to you, beloved! We tied the knot. What... what shall we do now?~
@124  = ~Ajantis, I didn't mean to! My actions were naive. Please, take it and return it to the temple. Would you do this for me?~
@125  = ~Alas, now it's all the same. I don't know what to say. Leave if you must. You're just hindering me as it is.~
@126  = ~My honor dictates it, <CHARNAME>, if you intend to work for thieves and assassins!~
@127  = ~No, Ajantis, please! I don't want to lose you... not by any means. My actions were naive. Please, take it and return it to the temple. Would you do this for me?~
@128  = ~I see. Then it's about time to break our engagement and go our separate ways.~
@129  = ~Then... then the time has come. Herewith our engagement is broken. I will return to the Order to collect myself...~
@130  = ~I cannot, <CHARNAME>. You've taken it wilfully... My heart is heavy with grief, but there's no other choice.~
@131  = ~<CHARNAME>, shall I work for some common thieves and criminals? We approach their den with stolen goods in our pocket. You're not serious, are you?!~ [c#ablank]
@132  = ~I can't approve of your course of action. I will return to the Order.~
@133  = ~I've told you before that I can't accept this doing. We will not meet again.~
@134  = ~My love, you... you know that I cannot allow this. What shall we do now?~
@135  = ~Please, Ajantis, I fail to see any other option.~
@136  = ~What we should have done long ago. Probably it's best that you leave.~
@137  = ~Another option for what?! Pleasing criminals and murderers? Why are you doing this?~
@138  = ~I want to avoid great bloodshed, Ajantis.~
@139  = ~Because I have reasons to do so, Ajantis. Can't you understand?~
@140  = ~Ajantis, I'm tired of your constant paternalism!~
@141  = ~You sell your soul for these thugs? This thieves' den should be smoked out. I cannot support you in this!~
@142  = ~Well, then it's probably about time to break off our engagement and to part with one another.~
@143  = ~Well, then it's probably about time to break off our relationship and to part with one another.~
@144  = ~What are you doing?! I must defend the Order!~ [c#ablank]
@145  = ~<CHARNAME>, these svirfneblin are not evil. I will not allow you to slaughter them!~ [c#ablank]
@146  = ~<CHARNAME>! What you are doing here is evil! By Helm! My honor dictates that I fight you! Evil must be purged wherever it is found, even among companions!~ [c#ajan29]
@147  = ~<CHARNAME>, I see that you're making decisions I cannot approve of time and again. Be sure to accomplish noble deeds and decide for the good of all in the future, or else I will be impelled to turn against you!~ [c#ablank]
@148  = ~And again you have done something I cannot approve of! I've already warned you. Now it comes to this... draw your weapon and defend yourself!~ [c#ablank]
@149  = ~I... I can't believe it has to end this way. Just as I believed you to be mine again!~
@150  = ~<CHARNAME>, I already know you from our times on the Sword Coast, but your reputation here in these parts is none too good. I trust this will take a turn for the better soon. Let's proceed together on the path of righteousness!~ [c#ablank]
@151  = ~<CHARNAME>, your reputation here in these parts is none too good. I trust this will take a turn for the better soon. Let's proceed together on the path of righteousness!~ [c#ablank]
@152  = ~<CHARNAME>, I'm dissatisfied with how you are leading this group. Our deeds do not speak of goodness and righteousness! We must help the people we encounter.~ [c#ablank]
@153  = ~<CHARNAME>, let our deeds shine in the light of good and righteousness. I am not satisfied with how you are leading this group.~ [c#ablank]
@154  = ~<CHARNAME>, our deeds don't speak the tongue of goodness and righteousness! We must help the people we encounter. Only thus shall we rise in estimation.~ [c#ablank]
@155  = ~By Helm! I cannot follow you on this path any longer! I can bear no more. Raise your weapon and defend yourself.~ [c#ajan31]
@156  = ~By Helm! I cannot follow you on this path any longer! Your deeds are evil! I... I've failed, beloved. Draw your weapon and defend yourself!~ [c#ajan31]
@157  = ~<CHARNAME>, I'm not happy about how this group is turning out. Our actions are casting a dark shadow upon us, while we should spread the light of honesty instead. We cannot go on like this! I will not stand by while this party descends into depravity.~ [c#ajan06]
@158  = ~Ajantis, I'm not happy either. Trust me though, our actions will shine in a better light again soon.~
@159  = ~Ajantis, I have a mission to complete, and that's exactly what I am doing, namely the best I can.~
@160  = ~Ahhhh, what's that supposed to mean? Not everyone can shine with honesty. Our deeds provide the means to achieve our goals, no more, no less.~
@161  = ~It relieves me to hear this, <CHARNAME>. With an expectation of an improvement, I will continue to follow you, even if the current situation is barely agreeable with my duties as a knight.~
@162  = ~It relieves me to hear it, my love. I can't believe that I have thought so wrong of you. Let us move on and please Helm with our future actions. The current situation is barely consistent with my duties as a knight.~
@163  = ~As 'best' as you can, <CHARNAME>? I'm beginning to doubt it. There's something evil about your actions, and that doesn't go well with my duties as a knight. I shall keep on following you, but we must resume the proper path.~
@164  = ~As 'best' as you can, <CHARNAME>? I... I'm beginning to doubt it. Don't misunderstand me, my love, but there's an evil touch about your actions. I can't reconcile this with my duties as a knight anymore. Let's resume the proper path quickly!~
@165  = ~If that's as it is, I'm beginning to doubt that your goals are the same as mine, <CHARNAME>. There's something evil about your actions, and that doesn't go well with my duties as a knight. I shall keep on following you, but we must resume the proper path.~
@166  = ~What a tone you are speaking to me in! I can't believe you've fooled me like this. I... I'm beginning to doubt, my love. There's something evil about your actions, and that doesn't go well with my duties as a knight. Let us move on and please Helm with our future actions! Please, show me you're still the person I thought you to be.~
@167  = ~<CHARNAME>, this deed was a noble one! I see we're headed in the right direction now. Let us proceed in this sense!~ [c#ablank]
@168  = ~<CHARNAME>, I am deeply contented with our deeds. We follow the righteous path, the path of Helm. I thank Helm most sincerely for we are fighting together again. Let us keep it up!~ [c#ajan04]
@169  = ~<CHARNAME>, your deeds reflect your true colors of righteousness. I'm delighted with our course! Let us proceed as bravely furthermore!~ [c#ablank]
@170  = ~With the decision you made to solve this trial, you chose the dark side, <CHARNAME>, for it was evil.~
@171  = ~Well, I'm not really surprised. So let us face this monstrosity Irenicus. But I will keep an eye on you, as I have done before.~
@172  = ~I watch your change of heart with great interest, <CHARNAME>. It seems that your dark side gains the mastery. So let us face this monstrous Irenicus. But I will keep an eye on you, as I have done before.~
@173  = ~<CHARNAME>, you turned! You turned to the dark!~ [c#ablank]
@174  = ~Now, of all times - so close to your reunition with your soul, the evil takes you over!~
@175  = ~You, the light of my heart, lost to the evil...~
@176  = ~I... I know it is the loss of your soul. It has to be! But it happened...~
@177  = ~<CHARNAME>, I cannot be the betrothed of an evil woman... Helm forgive me, but I have to break my vow!~
@178  = ~I am delighted to see you tread the path of light, <CHARNAME>! You have solved all the imposed trials in a truly virtuous way.~ [c#ablank]
@179  = ~I watch your change of heart with great interest. Could you take a turn for the better after all? This deed raises my hopes. Now I wish to join you in this final battle ahead all the more!~
@180  = ~I did expect no less from you, but it's pleasant to watch you tread the path of righteousness without hesitation.~
@181  = ~Let us rout Irenicus, for he's a monster. You have displayed true grandness, however.~
@182  = ~Let us rout Irenicus, for he's a monster. You, however, have displayed true grandness, my love.~
@183  = ~Now we are under an illusionary spell of a mighty wyrm once more, our shapes transformed...~ [c#ablank]
@184  = ~I'm aware of the difference, and I haven't forgotten our obligation to the good Lady Silver. But still, unpleasant memories suggest themselves, memories of the red wyrm's powerful magic, which fooled us in the Windspear Hills.~
@185  = ~The magic of dragons is powerful indeed, and mortals that we are should be glad if they're well-disposed towards us.~
@186  = ~Uh, you're right. This memory is quite unpleasant, so let's hurry. Then we'll be out of this more quickly.~
@187  = ~As you said already, the situation is completely different.~
@188  = ~Then let's not talk about it further.~
@189  = ~Indeed. Now then, let's conclude this task and leave this creepy place.~
@190  = ~As you wish. Let's conclude this task and leave this creepy place.~
@191  = ~My suggestion is all the same. Let's go about our task and leave this creepy place.~
@192  = ~What was the point of this cruel game, <CHARNAME>?! To pretend you want to sacrifice those desperate people to the Spider Queen... Are you completely out of your mind?!~ [c#ablank]
@193  = ~I know it might sound questionable now, but I just wanted to see how far I could go.~
@194  = ~(sigh) Fortunately, you were there to set it right.~
@195  = ~(sigh) Fortunately, you were there to set it right.~
@196  = ~I had a good reason to do so. What's the problem?~
@197  = ~I wonder which of us is truly out of their mind. You disobey all too often, paladin, and this was the last time!~
@198  = ~Really? Well, your former deeds put a favorable complexion on you, so there's still hope for you. I will keep an eye on you, however, <CHARNAME>, and I will not hesitate to bring you to account for any evil actions.~
@199  = ~That's stretching it too far! Your doings were villainous! I call you to account here and now. Draw your weapon and defend yourself! For the glory of Helm!~ [c#ajan03]
@200  = ~You don't say! I am honor-bound as a paladin. Those doings were villainous! Your evil ways end here. Draw steel, and we will settle this dispute once and for all!~ [c#ajan07]
@201  = ~Save your mockery! As a paladin, I am honor-bound, something alien to your nature, it seems. Those doings were villainous! Your evil ways end here. Draw steel and we will settle this dispute once and for all!~ [c#ajan07]
@202  = ~I don't believe a word of it! As a paladin, I am honor-bound, something alien to your nature, it seems. Those doings were villainous! Your evil ways end here. Draw steel, and we will settle this dispute once and for all!~ [c#ajan07]
@203  = ~Are you mocking me? Well, your former deeds put a favorable complexion on you, so there's still hope for you. I will keep an eye on you, however, <CHARNAME>, and I will not hesitate to bring you to account for any evil actions.~
@204  = ~Especially... especially from you of whom I had never expected such a thing! Explain yourself, my love!~
@205  = ~I'm against it myself. I will never do something like that again.~
@206  = ~Ajantis, I wanted it exactly this way. Why are you always interfering in my business?!~
@207  = ~That's stretching it too far! You had the chance to change your mind and to rescue those people, but you wanted to send them to the temple willingly instead!~
@208  = ~It's true. I don't know what got into me. Please help me hereafter, so that something of the kind won't happen again!~
@209  = ~Perhaps I wanted it that way. Why are you always interfering in my business?!~
@210  = ~Then I shall stand by your side to make sure that such a thing will not happen again. Is it your dark side revealing itself here? (sigh) It is a cruel fate you have to cope with, <CHARNAME>. Do not embrace it.~
@211  = ~I hear your words with horror! Is this your dark side revealing itself? I wanted to stand by your side, to support you. Now there's only one way left to help you... I will turn against you here and now! Draw your weapon!~
@212  = ~<CHARNAME>, I wish to speak with you again about the slaves we have freed in Ust Natha. It was very noble to redeem and release them.~ [c#ablank]
@213  = ~It's very nice of you to say so, Ajantis.~
@214  = ~Yes, and I truly hope they'll make it to the surface.~
@215  = ~Bah, whatever. I could've invested the money better.~
@216  = ~I don't know... perhaps I could've invested the money better.~
@217  = ~I knew you would start this topic up again, Ajantis.~
@218  = ~It did not escape my notice that it was a risky undertaking. We had just a small amount of time to redeem them. At first, we had no way of accomplishing it, then later too much lingering before the 'ritual' could have annoyed the Matron Mother and endangered us. You have chosen an advantageous moment, and I am happy you took the opportunity to minister to these souls.~
@219  = ~The provided equipment should definitely give them a better chance to reach the surface, after we have cleared the way for them.~
@220  = ~They may not have any equipment, but I hope they will reach the surface nevertheless, after we've cleared the way for them.~
@221  = ~Stay on this path of goodness, <CHARNAME>. It's the only true one.~
@222  = ~I would not expect any less from you, <CHARNAME>. You are treading the right path, and I am glad to travel it with you.~
@223  = ~I would not expect any less from you, my love. You are treading the right path, and once more I am glad to be by your side.~
@224  = ~Why would you say such a thing? There is reason to hope that they will reach the surface after we have cleared the way. Your gold was certainly not wasted by giving those poor people a chance to have a life of freedom.~
@225  = ~Hm, perhaps. It's kind of you to say so.~
@226  = ~I didn't mean it that way. I'm not interested in the slaves, Ajantis. They could have stayed in their cages. What's that to me?~
@227  = ~What makes you doubt your righteous action? There's reason to hope that they will reach the surface after we have cleared the way. Your gold was certainly not wasted by giving those poor people a chance to have a life of freedom.~
@228  = ~You're right, Ajantis. I shouldn't doubt.~
@229  = ~It did not escape my notice that it was a risky undertaking. We had just a small amount of time to redeem them. At first, we had no way of accomplishing it, then later too much lingering before the 'ritual' could have annoyed the Matron Mother and endangered us. You have chosen an advantageous moment, and I am happy you took the opportunity to see to these souls.~
@230  = ~You cannot be serious?~
@231  = ~Well, this deed is to your credit, even if you haven't found the true and only path yet.~
@232  = ~It did not escape my notice that it was a risky undertaking. We had just a a small amount of time to redeem them. At first, we had no way of accomplishing it, then later too much lingering before the 'ritual' could have annoyed the Matron Mother and endangered us. You have chosen an advantageous moment, and I am happy you took the opportunity to see to these souls - even if you do not feel confident about it anymore.~
@233  = ~I can hardly believe your doubt because I have seen you on the path of righteousness before. This deed speaks of your nobility as well. It was a risky undertaking, for we had just a small amount of time to redeem them. At first, we had no way of accomplishing it, then later too much lingering before the 'ritual' could have annoyed the Matron Mother and endangered us.~
@234  = ~You have chosen an advantageous moment, and I'm happy you took the opportunity to see to these souls - even if you don't feel confident about it anymore.~
@235  = ~I can hardly believe your doubt, beloved. I have seen you on the path of righteousness before. This deed speaks of your nobility as well. It was a risky undertaking, for we had just a small amount of time to redeem them. At first, we had no way of accomplishing it, then later too much lingering before the 'ritual' could have annoyed the Matron Mother and endangered us.~
@236  = ~Likely you're right. We shall wish them well.~
@237  = ~I don't doubt my deed, Ajantis; I regret it. Why do I waste gold on people I don't even know?~
@238  = ~I don't want to expand upon this, Ajantis.~
@239  = ~Well, then I won't speak about it further. Let us move on.~
@240  = ~Why so dismissive? It didn't escape my notice that it was a risky undertaking, for we had just a small amount of time to redeem them. At first, we had no way of accomplishing it, then later too much lingering before the 'ritual' could have annoyed the Matron Mother and endangered us. You've chosen an advantageous moment, and you took the opportunity to see to these souls. Therefore, I wish to express my approval.~
@241  = ~Well, that's nice.~
@242  = ~(Hmph) Fairly spoken, but I still think it's a waste of money.~
@243  = ~(sigh) Fairly spoken, but I can't get over the feeling that it was for naught.~
@251  = ~It was right to see to these souls. Go on in this sense and do not doubt! I shall support you as best as I'm capable.~
@252  = ~I can hardly believe your doubt, beloved. I have seen you on the path of righteousness before. This deed speaks of your nobility as well. It was right to see to these souls, even if you do not feel confident of it anymore.~
@253  = ~You're right, Ajantis. We shall wish them well.~
@254  = ~Don't ever lose heart on the path of goodness and righteousness. Go on in this sense and do not doubt! I shall support you as best as I'm capable.~
@255  = ~'Regret'? 'Waste'? I... I do not understand, <CHARNAME>. Isn't the welfare of those people rewarding enough? It hurts me to hear you speak in such a disparaging manner!~
@256  = ~I can hardly believe your doubt, my love. This deed is to your credit, even if you haven't found the one and only path yet. It was a risky undertaking, for we had just a small amount of time to redeem them. At first, we had no way of accomplishing it, then later too much lingering before the 'ritual' could have annoyed the Matron Mother and endangered us.~
@259  = ~I can hardly believe your doubt, my love. This deed is to your credit, even if you haven't found the one and only path yet. It was right to see to these souls, even if you don't feel confident of it anymore.~
@260  = ~<CHARNAME>, I wish to speak with you again about the slaves we saw in Ust Natha...~ [c#ablank]
@261  = ~It is regrettable that we were not able to help them, although I know that we had to see to our own fortune. It would have proven fatal to stir the mistrust of those evil creatures due to conspicuous bearing. Still, I wish there had been a way to aid them.~
@262  = ~<CHARNAME>, it pleases me that you see to those in need of help without hesitation. The innocent and anxious Lady Elgea is certainly very relieved that she's not in the clutches of her tormentors anymore!~ [c#ablank]
@263  = ~To do good is my ambition, Ajantis. It would have been vile not to set her free or even to collect the ransom.~
@264  = ~I wouldn't exactly label the Lady Elgea 'innocent and anxious', Ajantis... not really!~
@265  = ~Hm, yes, thank you, Ajantis.~
@266  = ~I wasn't in the mood for trouble with the city guard.~
@267  = ~Well... I regretted my kindheartedness the moment Lady Elgea was out the door!~
@268  = ~I don't want to talk about it, Ajantis.~
@269  = ~It is your ambition indeed, <CHARNAME>, and I am pleased to fight by your side. Let us proceed as bravely furthermore!~
@270  = ~That's the proper mindset, <CHARNAME>. We follow the righteous path, the path of Helm. Only this way we can spread goodness. Let further good deeds follow this one!~ [c#ajan04]
@271  = ~And yet you haven't exploited the potential of goodness and righteousness fully. But I hear your words with pleasure, for this is the only true attitude. Therefore, let further good deeds follow this one!~
@272  = ~Lady Elgea may act in a quite resolute manner, but she was a prisoner in the clutches of her captors. It's our duty to protect the innocent and not to utilize them to our own advantage. You accomplished it without hesitation.~
@273  = ~Hm, yes, thank you, Ajantis.~
@274  = ~Only this way can we spread goodness. Let further good deeds follow this one!~
@275  = ~Should this have been your only motivation? We shall see, <CHARNAME>. Let further good deeds follow this one!~
@276  = ~Is that so? I admit that Lady Elgea acted in a quite... resolute manner. But I still assume that you will let further good deeds follow this one.~
@277  = ~Forgive me. I already told you everything I wanted to tell you as it is, <CHARNAME>.~
@278  = ~<CHARNAME>, what have I heard? You are holding a lady captive for ransom?!~ [c#ablank]
@279  = ~I'm terrified by this evil deed. I joined you in good faith to accompany you on the path of righteousness. But now I see that there's an undreamed-of maliciousness in you. I call on you to return to the lady this instant and set her free!~
@280  = ~I'm mortified by this evil deed. I joined you in good faith to accompany you on the path of righteousness. Love, I believed you were on this path! But now I see that there is an undreamed-of maliciousness in you. I call on you to return to the lady this instant and set her free!~
@281  = ~<CHARNAME>, how could you hesitate to free this innocent and anxious lady from imprisonment!~ [c#ablank]
@282  = ~I'm sorry, Ajantis, but she was so rude that I could not help but teach her a lesson!~
@283  = ~I just wanted to see how much ransom she would bring in... I could really use the money!~
@284  = ~Why are you 'noble' paladins always interfering?!~
@285  = ~I've made a decision and I expect all party members to accept it!~
@286  = ~I just wanted to see how much ransom she would bring in...~
@287  = ~May I actually still decide for myself what is to be done, or will all decisions be made by the paladins around me?~
@288  = ~Ajantis, I've made a decision and I expect all party members to accept it!~
@289  = ~Lady Elgea may act in a quite resolute manner, but she was a prisoner in the clutches of her captors. It is our duty to protect the innocent and not to utilize them to our own advantage!~
@290  = ~I'm keen to guess - Helm said that, huh?~
@291  = ~Well, I have to admit that it wasn't exactly fair. But I just wanted to see how much ransom she would bring in... I could really use the money!~
@292  = ~'Our' duty. Ha! Why are you 'noble' paladins always interfering?!~
@293  = ~'Protect the weak, the poor, the invalid, and the young. Never impose upon them to your own or another one's advantage.' This is indeed a tenet promulgated by my god, <CHARNAME>.~
@294  = ~But not to me. Why are you 'noble' paladins always interfering?!~
@295  = ~It does not befit us to 'teach' the innocent, <CHARNAME>. Pull yourself together in the future, for it won't be the last time you feel roughly treated!~
@296  = ~Perhaps you're right. Let's move on.~
@297  = ~(mumble) Indeed, it happens constantly - as, for instance, with a certain paladin.~
@298  = ~As if I weren't in control of myself! Why are you 'noble' paladins always interfering?!~
@299  = ~What did you say?~
@300  = ~(sigh) Nothing, never mind. Let us move on.~
@301  = ~I wondered why you noble paladins must always interfere with my decisions!~
@302  = ~You wanted to perform this villainous crime out of greed for money? This is more than damnable! Be glad that your plan was stopped. I shall keep a *very* close eye on you from now on, <CHARNAME>, and I won't hesitate to bring you to account for any further evil deeds!~
@303  = ~How am I to understand this statement? It's the duty of any paladin to prevent evil, and your deed *was* evil!~
@304  = ~Your doings were more than damnable! Be glad they were stopped. I shall keep a *very* close eye on you from now on, <CHARNAME>, and I won't hesitate to bring you to account for any further evil deeds!~
@305  = ~I'm sorry, Ajantis, but she was rude in such a way that I felt a desperate need to teach her a lesson!~
@306  = ~Your duty, yes. But is it mine as well?~
@307  = ~You're right. (sigh) I didn't think her endangered anymore because we had already convicted her kidnappers, Ajantis.~
@308  = ~It does not befit us to 'teach' the innocent, <CHARNAME>. I thought you were more patient, my love. It won't be the last time you feel roughly treated, alas.~
@309  = ~(seriously) It's fortunate you're there to protect me from such people. And from myself as well.~
@310  = ~You are right. Let us move on.~
@311  = ~It doesn't befit you, perhaps. But *I* would have kept her in suspense awhile longer!~
@312  = ~You wanted to conclude this villainous crime out of greed for money? This is damnable, beloved! Be glad that your plan was choked off. Must I keep an eye on you perhaps, because your dark side reveals itself?~
@313  = ~No. I just didn't think her endangered anymore because we had already convicted her kidnappers, Ajantis.~
@314  = ~Perhaps? It seems I am well monitored already.~
@315  = ~What of it? It does not befit us to 'teach' the innocent, <CHARNAME>. I thought you were more patient, my love. It won't be the last time you feel roughly treated, alas.~
@316  = ~(smile) How fortunate that you're there to protect me from such people. And from myself as well.~
@319  = ~It had to be stopped. Please don't tell me you are yielding to your dark side?! The thought scares me, my love. I will be at your side to watch over you, so that you will never leave the path of righteousness. As a paladin and your spouse to be, I owe you that much.~
@320  = ~You are obliged to a paladin of Helm. What applies to me has to apply to you as well. If you don't realize that, we probably should reassess our relationship, my love!~
@321  = ~I will be at your side to watch over you, so that you will never leave the path of righteousness. As a paladin and your spouse to be, I owe you that much.~
@322  = ~<CHARNAME>, why did you try to deceive Sir Sarles about the true nature of the metal you offered him?~ [c#ablank]
@323  = ~It was wrong, Ajantis, I know. I just hoped he wouldn't notice, and that I could satisfy him this way.~
@324  = ~(sigh) Perhaps he wouldn't have noticed if a certain paladin from my own ranks hadn't bleated it out in front of him.~
@325  = ~Why, it wasn't exactly a lie, Ajantis. I just glossed it over a tad. I've been told that no one would distinguish the difference, after all.~
@326  = ~You wanted to satisfy all involved by use of a lie?~
@327  = ~This is doubtful.~
@328  = ~Well, I hope you will take the truth more seriously in the future.~
@329  = ~Experience has shown that lying never helps. Sir Sarles would have seen through the blended illithium. And now we have to perform the difficult task of reporting the unfortunate outcome of our negotiations.~
@330  = ~We must not answer the summons of this creature! She is girdled in the stench of death. It is most likely a trap! Be wary, <CHARNAME>.~ [c#ablank]
@331  = ~You are right, Ajantis. I sense the evil in her, too. We should be on guard indeed.~
@332  = ~Don't be so suspicious, Ajantis. We should at least hear her mistress' offer.~
@333  = ~It's up to me to decide what shall be done, Ajantis.~
@334  = ~I'm relieved that you see it that way as well, <CHARNAME>. Let's proceed accordingly.~
@335  = ~If you think... but I have warned you. We must tread wearily!~
@336  = ~That is true, it's up to you. But if it is for our own good remains to be seen! I have warned you. We must tread warily!~
@337  = ~<CHARNAME>, you wanted to leave this halfling woman in the clutches of the Shade Lord?! After she told us what happened to her companions and what grim fate would have awaited her?~ [c#ablank]
@338  = ~Truly, I wasn't sure if it was a setup... Good thing you interfered.~
@339  = ~We will destroy the Shade Lord anyway, Ajantis, or do you have concerns on that score?~
@340  = ~Ah, how fortunate that you touch upon this. I had *reasons* to do so, and again you've decided it arbitrarily. This was the last time!~
@341  = ~I had *reasons* to do so, and again you've decided it arbitrarily!~
@342  = ~Is that so? Well, then I'm glad it came out this way.~
@343  = ~Even if it succeeds, it's no reason for leaving the prisoners captured here, particularly since her body would have revitalized him. No, <CHARNAME>, the carelessness for the lot of others you've shown is despicable. I will keep on watching you very closely.~
@344  = ~Indeed? Well, a decision will be made here and now! Your evil ways end here. Draw steel, and we will settle this dispute once and for all.~ [c#ajan07]
@345  = ~It was our duty to set her free! No stretch of the imagination can conjure up a valid reason for your reaction!~
@346  = ~You see, that is exactly the problem. I can't stand your babbling anymore. We had better break off here and now.~
@347  = ~Even if it succeeds, it's no reason for leaving the prisoners captured here. Particularly as her body would have revitalized him. No, the carelessness for the lot of others you've shown is...  damnable, <CHARNAME>. From now on, I shall watch you closely, and be prepared should your dark side show again.~
@348  = ~You... wish to end our relationship?~
@349  = ~No, Ajantis, it was spoken in rage. Pray forgive me. Stay and keep on supporting me in the fight against the darkness lurking inside of me.~
@350  = ~Well, you have a bit of a problem with my decisions, after all.~
@351  = ~Spoken in rage it was, my love. (sigh) I have sworn to protect you, and I shall do so with all my might. From now on, I shall watch you closely, and be prepared should your dark side show again.~
@352  = ~It's not that simple! You have sworn an oath, <CHARNAME>. I remind you of your duties as my bride! Duty to one's cause outweighs all.~ [c#ajan24]
@353  = ~Ajantis, I'm truly sorry, but it would be no good. Please accept my decision and let me go.~
@354  = ~This is exactly one of the reasons why wedlock with you isn't bearable for me, Ajantis. You do not wish to see me happy?~
@355  = ~You appeal to the law? An engagement is not nearly so binding as marriage, Ajantis. And we are not married yet!~
@356  = ~It's not that simple! You have sworn an oath, <CHARNAME>. I remind you of your duties as my wife! Duty to one's cause outweighs all.~ [c#ajan24]
@357  = ~This is exactly one of the reasons why wedlock with you isn't bearable for me anymore, Ajantis. You do not wish to see me happy?~
@358  = ~That's the way I want it! And you appeal to the law?~
@359  = ~Ajantis, it was spoken in rage. Pray forgive me. Stay and keep on supporting me in the fight against the darkness lurking inside of me.~
@360  = ~I... I know there is no point in that. You are strong-minded indeed. No, I don't appeal to the law. There is no reason for that if the betrothed come to an agreement. You... you are free. I... I release you from your duties as my betrothed... my love.~
@361  = ~So... so shall it be. We part ways and our collective life here, then. Seek me out in the Order's headquarters in Athkatla if you need my assistance as a comrade-in-arms. Perhaps I will be willing to join you again.~
@362  = ~I... I know there is no point in that. You are strong-minded indeed. No, I don't appeal to the law. There is no reason for that if a husband releases his wife. You... you are free. I release you from your duties as my wife, my love.~
@363  = ~So... so shall it be. We part ways and our collective life here, then. Our union was made for a lifetime, <CHARNAME>... I shall leave and pray for mercy, so that my god may forgive me. Fare... Farewell.~
@364  = ~You allowed this awful piece of armor to be completed?! Wearing it does not seem to be your intention. If you do, however, I will be forced to avenge the murdered souls locked within it. But perhaps the victims shall win peace if we would bring the skins to a temple. I would suggest doing so as soon as possible. This evil product has to be destroyed!~ [c#ablank]
@365  = ~You allowed this awful piece of armor to be completed?! I don't know what provoked you into that. Do not try to wear it, or I shall avenge the murdered souls!~ [c#ablank]
@366  = ~You... you allow this spawn of abomination to be used?! I will avenge the murdered souls!~ [c#ablank]
@367  = ~You would really do it! What a blatant ugly deed! I can bear no more. Raise your weapon and defend yourself.~ [c#ajan31]
@368  = ~What... what happened here?! Large parts of the Promenade are destroyed. *This* happened during the battle you referred to?~ [c#ablank]
@369  = ~That's right, Irenicus destroyed it while fighting the Shadow Thieves, just before I managed to flee his dungeon and the Cowled Wizards took Imoen.~
@370  = ~Well, so what! What's past is past.~
@371  = ~My goodness, how long has it been since you were here?~
@372  = ~I don't wish to speak about it now.~
@373  = ~I have heard of the destruction, but I didn't realize the dimension of it. The debris bears witness to great power. We shall brace ourselves before facing this Irenicus!~
@374  = ~Well, you're aware of my whereabouts during the time you forced your way out. I tread this place for the first time since then.~
@375  = ~Of course, never mind. I had heard of the destruction, but I didn't realize the dimension of it. The debris bears witness to great power. We shall brace ourselves before facing this Irenicus!~
@376  = ~I can very well understand that, my love. I had heard of the destruction, but I didn't realize the dimension of it. The debris bears witness to great power. We shall brace ourselves before facing this Irenicus!~
@377  = ~It is also regrettable for another reason. There was a nice shop on the side that now lies destroyed. I had hoped to attend it with you someday...~
@378  = ~Are you referring to the goldsmith's shop of Master Surianko, by chance? I have encountered him. He's vending his jewelry at the Mithrest Inn at the moment.~
@379  = ~Truly? Which shop do you mean?~
@380  = ~Well, surely there are enough other shops in this town.~
@381  = ~Well... Master Surianko's goldsmith shop used to be located on the destroyed side of the Promenade. We should find him in the Mithrest Inn now.~
@382  = ~But now I've delayed you long enough. We shall stop by Master Surianko in good time, when our duties allow it.~
@383  = ~Quite true, but the shop I'm speaking of has no peer in the entirety of Amn.~
@384  = ~Now I'm curious. Which shop do you mean?~
@385  = ~And that would be?~
@386  = ~Is this conversation going to be over soon?~
@387  = ~I wasn't aware that it interests you so little. Forgive me, <CHARNAME>... It's not that important. Not yet, however. I shall touch upon it again in good time.~
@388  = ~(blushes) You've got me. Yes, I have been in his smithy once and wondered what would be to your liking...~
@389  = ~He markets at the Mithrest Inn now? These are good tidings. In the first place, it is reassuring to know that the explosion did not claim even more victims. Furthermore it is pleasant that Master Surianko's treasures are still obtainable.~
@390  = ~We could go there someday, yes...?~
@391  = ~Indeed. Let's move on.~
@393  = ~Wedding bands, <CHARNAME>.~
@394  = ~Ah! Then we shall stop by his shop soon.~
@395  = ~We will, beloved. He truly has the finest choice of... (ahem) Master Surianko's art is well-known far beyond Athkatla, <CHARNAME>.~
@396  = ~'The finest choice of...' what, pray tell?~
@397  = ~You're right, we've been talking long enough. We shall stop by Master Surianko in good time, when our duties allow it.~
@398  = ~We will. But now I've delayed you long enough. We shall stop by Master Surianko in good time, when our duties allow it.~
@399  = ~(blushes) Master Surianko's goldsmith's shop, <CHARNAME>. I've been in his smithy once and wondered what would be to your liking...~
@400  = ~I shall keep my eyes open, perhaps he yet offers his wares somewhere around here. I cannot imagine he would display his treasures on the *street*, though.~
@401  = ~I have encountered him. He's vending his jewelry in the Mithrest Inn at the moment.~
@402  = ~Oh, that's sweet, Ajantis!~
@403  = ~Goldsmith's shop, I see. (smile) Yes, I would like to go there with you, Ajantis.~
@404  = ~Do you think he's still around here?~
@405  = ~Oh! (smile) Yes, I would like to go there with you, Ajantis.~
@406  = ~Well, we shall see. But I suppose he should be located in this district. He truly had the finest choice of... (ahem) Master Surianko's art is well-known far beyond Athkatla, <CHARNAME>.~
@407  = ~(smile) Another one of my poor attempts to please you, my love.~
@408  = ~Ah, there he is, <CHARNAME>! Master Surianko, the best goldsmith throughout Amn, and well known throughout the region.~
@409  = ~We... could take a look on his assortment. If we can spare the time, of course.~
@410  = ~So these are the forsaken realms of Bhaal... A horrible place.~ [c#ablank]
@411  = ~It's eerie... I'm sorry that you've been dragged down here, Ajantis.~
@412  = ~Yes, I find it awful, too.~
@413  = ~It's just connected to me due to my heritage.~
@414  = ~Why are you whining? You're aware of my heritage. We've discussed this and the Prophecies of Alaundo extensively enough on the Sword Coast!~

@416  = ~I know, <CHARNAME>. Lately I had been watching out for the evil that might burst out of you. But all my vigilance was not enough to prepare me for this.~
@417  = ~Be wary, and don't leave the righteous path! I'll be on alert, however.~
@418  = ~It's not your fault... so to say. Lately I had been watching out for the evil that might burst out of you. But all my vigilance was not enough to prepare me for this.~
@419  = ~Lately I had been watching out for the evil that might burst out of you. But all my vigilance was not enough to prepare me for this.~
@420  = ~The death of Sir Keldorn is a great loss to us all. I hope there will be a way to restore this righteous knight.~ [c#ablank]
@421  = ~Sir Keldorn, I am very happy and relieved to see you alive and well again. Let us be better prepared next time we go into battle!~ [c#ablank]
@422  = ~Forgive the intrusion, my lady, but it appears that Anomen holds you in high regard.~ [c#ablank]
@423  = ~Whatever do you mean, Ajantis?~
@424  = ~Yes, I believe that is the case. Unfortunately, I do not return his affection.~
@425  = ~His attention is welcome, Sir Ajantis. Anomen is an attractive man.~
@426  = ~Yes, I know. But I'm still keeping my options open.~
@427  = ~My love life is none of your business.~
@428  = ~As you must be aware, Anomen is a squire of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart. I do not claim to be in his confidence, but I know that he is usually more reserved toward the ladies of his acquaintance. His candor and his interest in you suggest that he might harbor feelings for you.~
@429  = ~If that is as you say, then I welcome his attention.~
@430  = ~He might be interested, but I am not.~
@431  = ~Thank you for your observations, but I need to consider my feelings on the subject.~
@432  = ~Please do not concern yourself. I can make my own decisions.~
@433  = ~You know your own heart, my lady, but if you will forgive my saying so, it might be best to let him down gently, but soon. Anomen means well, but he has his own troubles. He should not have his hopes raised, only to have them dashed.~
@434  = ~I know, Sir Ajantis, but the time is not yet right.~
@435  = ~Oh, I don't know about that. The attention is nice, and he doesn't seem to mind.~
@436  = ~Sir Ajantis, you go too far. This is really none of your concern.~
@437  = ~He is a good man, but faces many trials. He relies heavily on your judgement, my lady. With your guidance, he might rise above his troubles. Please use whatever discretion is at your disposal to keep him on the path of Helm. He will thank you for it, my lady.~
@438  = ~I shall keep that in mind. Thank you for your opinion.~
@439  = ~Anomen is old enough to make his own decisions. I will not tell him what to do.~
@440  = ~I am still undecided about how far I want this relationship to go. I need to think about it some more.~
@441  = ~Sir Ajantis, please do not interfere in our relationship.~
@442  = ~I would never advise to enter a commitment before you are prepared to do so, my lady. But I would encourage you to give it some thought. No doubt Anomen thinks of little else.~
@443  = ~I will think on it. Thank you for your concern.~
@444  = ~Are you this nosey with everyone?~
@445  = ~Sir Ajantis, do not trouble yourself. We'll work it out when we're ready.~
@446  = ~It was not my intention to interfere in your personal life, my lady. I am sorry if I have offended you.~
@447  = ~I am sure you know best, my lady. I shall leave the situation to your mercy and your discretion.~
@448  = ~My lady, that would be cruel. I shall leave the matter to your mercy and your discretion, but I urge you to reconsider.~
@449  = ~Then I shall leave the matter in your capable hands. I trust your wisdom and discretion.~
@450  = ~I apologize. It was not my intention to pry. I merely wished the best possible outcome for both of you. I shall say no more on the matter.~
@451  = ~<CHARNAME>, would you step aside a moment?~ [c#ablank]
@452  = ~That was a difficult decision Anomen had to make. I thank you for the strength and support you gave him when he needed it most. It remains to be seen how this decision will affect him, but I hope, in time, that he may take some comfort in the fact that his lawful behavior is pleasing to Helm, if not to his father.~
@453  = ~Indeed, Anomen's choice was not easy, but I am glad he was able to find strength in his convictions.~
@454  = ~He could hardly let that old sot walk all over him, could he?~
@455  = ~It doesn't really matter.~
@456  = ~As am I.~
@457  = ~I would hope Anomen was driven by more than defiance, as well as you, <CHARNAME>.~
@458  = ~Do you think so? It does, to him.~
@459  = ~That was a difficult decision Anomen had to make. I am somewhat... disappointed by the sort of encouragement you gave him. I hope he will not regret his action.~
@460  = ~That was his dead sister in that urn!~
@461  = ~He will do what he thinks is right.~
@462  = ~Revenge will not return his sister to life, and he has made a vow. He must live with the consequences.~
@463  = ~He has made a vow. He must live with the consequences.~
@464  = ~It does, to him!~
@465  = ~<CHARNAME>, may I have a word with you apart from the others?~ [c#ablank]
@466  = ~Sir Anomen has been tested and found worthy, and I am happy for him. He certainly deserves the honor bestowed upon him. But surely, he owes some of his success to the good advice he received.~
@467  = ~If you are referring to the advice I gave him, I thank you, but I would like to think he would have reached that decision on his own.~
@468  = ~If you are referring to the advice I gave him, I thank you, but all I did was give him a nudge down the path I thought would make him happier in the end.~
@469  = ~Well, thank you. I did what I thought best.~
@470  = ~Yes, he does flounder about if you don't walk him through everything, doesn't he?~
@471  = ~I should like to think so, but... well, please allow me to congratulate you for having such a positive influence. I have no doubt that Anomen will look back on his trials and be content that he made the right choice. Nor will he forget whose words gave him the encouragement he needed.~
@472  = ~Sometimes, we all need a bit of help. Please allow me to congratulate you for having such a positive influence. I have no doubt that Anomen will look back on his trials and be content that he made the right choice. Nor will he forget whose words gave him the encouragement he needed.~
@473  = ~Then, please allow me to congratulate you for having such a positive influence. I have no doubt that Anomen will look back on his trials and be content that he made the right choice. Nor will he forget whose words gave him the encouragement he needed.~
@474  = ~I think that this success will give him a bit more confidence, even if he needed help at the time.~
@475  = ~<CHARNAME>, may I have a word with you apart from the others?~ [c#ablank]
@476  = ~Sir Anomen has been tested and found worthy, and I am happy for him. He certainly deserves the honor bestowed upon him. But surely, love, he owes some of his success to your good advice.~
@477  = ~Thank you, Ajantis, but I would like to think he would have reached that decision on his own.~
@478  = ~Thank you, Ajantis, but all I did was give him a nudge down the path I thought would make him happier in the end.~
@479  = ~Thank you. I did what I thought best.~
@480  = ~I should like to think so, but... well, let us say that your advice was timely and wise. I have no doubt that Sir Anomen will look back on his trials and be content that he made the right choice. Nor will he forget whose words gave him the encouragement he needed.~
@481  = ~Yes, my love, sometimes, we all need a bit of help. Still, your guidance was both wise and timely. I have no doubt that Sir Anomen will look back on his trials and be content that he made the right choice. Nor will he forget whose words gave him the encouragement he needed.~
@482  = ~And it has worked out for the best for everyone involved, my love. I have no doubt that Sir Anomen will look back on his trials and be content that he made the right choice. Nor will he forget whose words gave him the encouragement he needed.~
@483  = ~Anomen has been tested and found wanting, <CHARNAME>, and I am saddened by this result. He certainly did not make the best decision. But surely, he did not reach this decision in the absence of any advice.~
@484  = ~If you are referring to the advice I gave him, he would have reached that decision with or without my advice.~
@485  = ~If you are referring to the advice I gave him, all I did was give him a nudge down the path I thought would bring him the most satisfaction.~
@486  = ~I did what I thought best.~
@487  = ~Mind your own business, paladin!~
@488  = ~(sigh) Perhaps, but what is done, is done, and Anomen must be held responsible for his own decisions. I cannot change the past, but I must inform you that it is my duty as a paladin to maintain vigilance. I had hoped that you would exert what influence you might have... differently. I will watch your decisions very carefully.~
@489  = ~Although I cannot agree with his decisions, Anomen must be held responsible for them. I only hope that such satisfaction as he receives will compensate him for his loss.~
@490  = ~I cannot change the past, but I must inform you that it is my duty as a paladin to maintain vigilance. I had hoped that you would exert what influence you might have... differently. I will watch your decisions very carefully.~
@491  = ~I shall mind my own business, even as Anomen must live with the consequences of his decision. And it is my duty as a paladin to maintain vigilance. I had hoped that you would exert what influence you might have... differently. I will watch your decisions very carefully.~
@492  = ~My love, may I have a word with you apart from the others?~ [c#ablank]
@493  = ~Anomen has been tested and found wanting, Lady <CHARNAME>, and I am saddened by this result. He certainly did not make the best decision. But surely, he did not reach this decision in the absence of any advice.~
@494  = ~(sigh) Perhaps, but what is done, is done, and Anomen must be held responsible for his own decisions. My love, I am honestly amazed that you offered him the advice you did.~
@495  = ~Honestly, <CHARNAME>, I am amazed by what you 'thought best'. Ultimately, of course, Anomen must live with the consequences of his own decisions, but he did not make them alone. After all we've been through, and all we've shared, I had not thought you would encourage such lawlessness.~
@496  = ~I had hoped that you would exert whatever influence you might have... differently. It saddens me, my love, but I must watch your decisions very carefully.~
@497  = ~I shall mind my own business, even as Anomen must live with the consequences of his decision. And it is my duty as a paladin to maintain vigilance.

@498  = ~I cannot change the past, but I must inform you that it is my duty as a paladin to maintain vigilance. I had hoped that you would exert whatever influence you might have... differently. It saddens me, but I must watch your decisions very carefully.~
@499  = ~I learned you were expelled from the Most Holy Order of the Radiant Heart! <CHARNAME>, this is great shame you put on yourself. Under these circumstances, I am incapable of accompanying you further. I will seek a place where I will be able to fulfill my duty better. Farewell.~ [c#ablank]
@500  = ~It is a harsh truth that you were expelled from the Most Holy Order of the Radiant Heart! <CHARNAME>, this is great shame you put on yourself. Under these circumstances, I am incapable of accompanying you further. I will seek a place where I will be able to fulfill my duty better. Farewell.~ [c#ablank]
@501  = ~<CHARNAME>, you failed as a priestess of Helm, and the church has abandoned you! How could you let this happen?~ [c#ablank]
@502  = ~I helped and gave advice as well as I could, Ajantis!~
@503  = ~I waited for you to comment on that.~
@504  = ~Actually I am quite happy to be rid of them.~
@505  = ~Whatever your motivation was, as a paladin of Helm, I cannot be your betrothed any longer!~
@506  = ~That... that means we cannot stay together any longer. We made a vow... <CHARNAME>, I will... go and seek forgetting in fighting missions of the Order. Fare... farewell.~
@507  = ~Whatever your reason was, I am a paladin of Helm. I cannot follow you any longer. Farewell.~
@508  = ~<CHARNAME>, it is a great pity we didn't keep my family shield. I can only hope you have a sincere reason for its absence.~ [c#ablank]
@509  = ~If this shield means a lot to you, we will get it back as soon as possible.~
@510  = ~It is at a safe place now, and you have better armor.~
@511  = ~Oh, dear. Please stop this whining. I'm sure your wealthy family won't even notice it's gone.~
@512  = ~That was an unfriendly remark, <CHARNAME>.~
@513  = ~I do not insist on using it, since it might not provide the best protection against the enemies we face, but it is still an item of great value to me... And it belongs to my family, truth be told.~
@514  = ~My family shield! There it is. <CHARNAME>, it is good we have it back.~ [c#ablank]
@515  = ~Stop this insane questioning! You are twisting <PRO_HISHER> words!~
@516  = ~No more interruptions! Is it too much to ask for <PRO_HIMHER> to answer a question about <PRO_HISHER> favorite color?!~
@517  = ~Imprison Lady <CHARNAME>?! I will never allow such a thing!~
@518  = ~Of course we will face this evil being! It is a matter of honor!~
@519  = ~We *will* return, foul beast! Your fate is sealed!~
@520  = ~In Helm's name, <CHARNAME>! I hear your words with horror! We are here to demand justice for the Order and for Lord Garren Windspear!~
@521  = ~<CHARNAME>! This is evil! I will not take your betrayal of Lord Windspear lying down. Defend yourself!~
@522  = ~<CHARNAME>! This is evil! I'll not take your betrayal of Lord Windspear lying down. Defend yourself!~
@523  = ~<CHARNAME>! This is evil! I will not take your betrayal of Lord Windspear lying down. I... I have to fight you. Defend yourself!~
@524  = ~I wouldn't have remained silent to this deception either, Sir Keldorn. <CHARNAME>, this is against my principles.~
@525  = ~Sir Sarles, I assure you that <CHARNAME> had good reasons to believe this material would fulfill your demand.~
@526  = ~Wait! Whom do I see! Sir Ajantis, my former squire and now an honored knight himself. I greet you! Seeing you in this group should allay my suspicion.~
@527  = ~Sir Keldorn, my former mentor and highest esteemed knight of the Order! I am happy to see you.~
@528  = ~I am also happy about this unexpected reunion. But duty demands that we don't forget the reasons for our being here. I have to ask for your answer!~
@529  = ~Sir Keldorn, my former teacher and good comrade! I am shocked to see you so distressed! What happened?~
@530  = ~My friend, you see me more desperate than I have ever been. Please, <CHARNAME>, stand by my side and help me!~
@531  = ~<CHARNAME>, do you really want to offer Sir Sarles inferior material? It didn't sound as if he would be satisfied with that.~
@532  = ~This... this is utmost joyful! I hadn't expected this happy ending. So defeat turns into victory!~
@533  = ~No, I will not be mute about this lie.~
@534  = ~Sir Sarles, forgive us. What you're holding in your hands is not pure illithium, but an alloy! I can assure you, though, that <CHARNAME> tried to fulfill your demand!~
@535  = ~Sir? Are you listening?~
@536  = ~<CHARNAME>, what horror must I see here! We have to help these people!~
@537  = ~<CHARNAME>, let us free these desperate people soon!~
@538  = ~By Helm, your words are horrifying me, <CHARNAME>! Denying those people aid is most vile! It must be your endeavor to thwart slavery, and I demand accountability from you here and now!~
@539  = ~Anomen, in Helm's name! You don't want to take vengeance for your sister's death in this brutal manner! Remember the tenets of the Order whose knight you are!~
@540  = ~Anomen, in Helm's name! You don't want to take vengeance for your sister's death in this brutal manner! Remember the tenets of the Order whose knight you yearn to become.~
@541  = ~<CHARNAME>, let us help the Order. I'm asking you in behalf of my comrades!~
@542  = ~This... this was the likeness of evil! The avatar of Bhaal! <CHARNAME>, you must be strong! Do not let it overcome you!~
@543  = ~Are you well, <CHARNAME>? You looked in vertigo for a moment.~
@544  = ~This must be gruelling for you. Let us move on and regain your soul!~
@545  = ~He is dead! So that's it? Do you feel different now, <CHARNAME>?~
@546  = ~What a gruesome experience! Where are we? What portrait of evil surrounds us! I fear for you, <CHARNAME>. Let's get closer together and see how we can find our way out of this area soon!~
@547  = ~What a gruesome experience! Where are we? What kind of manifested evil surrounds us! I fear for you, <CHARNAME>. But it has to be, and we will face the evil. Let me fight close at your side!~
@548  = ~You will die, evil creature!~
@549  = ~You will die, evil creature! No more will you trouble my beloved. NO MORE!~
@550  = ~Sir Ajantis, your faithful paladin. Back on the Sword Coast, he fought by your side. But his life is dedicated to Helm and the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart. On his Order's behalf, he strives for the good and righteous. Why would he walk down with you?~
@551  = ~Ajantis, it's my personal fight; you don't have to come along.~
@552  = ~You felt Irenicus' power, Ajantis. You don't have to come along.~
@553  = ~Are you determined and prepared for this fight, Ajantis? I must know if I can count on you when we descend these stairs.~
@554  = ~His gaze rests upon you as you turn to him.~
@555  = ~Ajantis, do you...~
@556  = ~Sir Ajantis, your faithful paladin and beloved. By your side, he fights on Helm's behalf for the good. His gaze rests upon you as you turn to him.~
@557  = ~Ajantis... I...~
@558  = ~Let us go below and get this monster of a man! I promised to aid you, and I won't disappoint you!~
@559  = ~No, don't speak, <CHARNAME>. I am there for you as I will be forever more. I'll stand by your side in your fight for your soul. This is also my fight, for I don't want to be - and I cannot be - without you anymore!~
@560  = ~Let us go below and get this monster of a man!~
@561  = ~I had hoped to call you my wife by now. But I understand better than anyone that other things have priority now. When we recover your soul, we shall find the peace we need to tie the knot. Let us go below and get this monster of a man!~
@562  = ~No, do not speak, <CHARNAME>. I will stand by your side in your fight for your soul. I am there for you as I will be forever more... if you want me to. I... (coughs) Let us go down, my lady.~
@563  = ~I do not feel well at the thought of having to work for the Shadow Thieves... but I fear we have to play their games for Imoen's sake. I will help you as long as I can fulfill the tasks with a clear conscience.~
@564  = ~<CHARNAME>, do we really have to collaborate with the Shadow Thieves?~
@565  = ~Well, it seems to be the only way to rescue Imoen right now. But you may rest assured that I won't hesitate to let the light of righteousness shine, should it be necessary.~
@566  = ~I will support this as long as it means gathering information about those criminals. But I will not tolerate breaking the law, <CHARNAME>. Remember this.~
@567  = ~You... you wouldn't take it into consideration, my love? I had banked on the thought that you won't use this part of your training for such purposes!~
@568  = ~Now you became a Shadow Thief, and not only this! The Order will observe your activities, <CHARNAME>. Should it ever come to a confrontation, I cannot fight on your side.~
@569  = ~Maybe you should reconsider whether you want a knight of the Order in your party furthermore, <CHARNAME>.~
@570  = ~You're right, <CHARNAME>. Refuse him bluntly. Let us never fetch and carry for these criminals!~
@571  = ~I cannot approve of this theft! Then we would be on the same level as these thieves. I cannot support you in this. Your... entire behavior doesn't reflect the righteousness I had hoped for. I shall not rejoin you until you appear in a better light. Farewell.~
@572  = ~I cannot approve of this theft! Then we would be on the same level as these thieves. I cannot support you in this. Your deeds don't reflect the righteousness I expect, beloved.~
@573  = ~You can't be serious! <CHARNAME>, I cannot approve of this theft! Then we would be on the same level as these thieves!~
@574  = ~Well, I see, you wish to gain Mae'Var's full confidence. <CHARNAME>, we should check first if we could not speak with this Embarl. What this thieves' chief calls a traitor could turn out to be a refined man, whose life we shouldn't end without good reasons.~
@575  = ~I had hoped you wouldn't kill this man blindly, but rather determine if he renounced his damnable existence as a Shadow Thief. But now, after you have shown him mercy, I'm not sure if it came across properly. Let us hope that he will renounce this occupation forthwith.~
@576  = ~Do not worry about me, knight. Haha, I am gone!~
@577  = ~I will not tolerate us becoming handymen of this evil wizard by any means! <CHARNAME>, I trust we will find out if this Cowled Wizard deserves this first.~
@578  = ~(sighs) Once again, we are playing stooges to this puffed up contemptible person. I advise you not to deploy any two-faced practices in this matter. I can't approve of a theft or the like.~
@579  = ~Why do you accept this arrogant, evil mage into the party, <CHARNAME>?! He shall exercise great care with his utterances, or else this will assuredly lead to strife.~
@580  = ~And here he is again, this pompous would-be knight! (Really, I don't know why I am doing this to myself.)~
@581  = ~<CHARNAME>, this creature is evil... evil to the core. By Helm! We must regard her words with utmost caution.~
@582  = ~No! By Helm, my love, you wouldn't consider an alliance with this dreadful creature?!~
@583  = ~I cannot become a servant of this creature! With this, you are on your own, <CHARNAME>.~
@584  = ~I cannot become a servant of this creature! I thought better of you... With this, you are on your own, <CHARNAME>.~
@585  = ~I cannot become a servant of this creature! <CHARNAME>, I don't have another choice, for what you're doing is evil...~
@586  = ~We shall bring your evil existence to an end, as it is our duty! You don't frighten us! <CHARNAME>, I'm glad you rejected this creature's offer.~
@587  = ~It might well be you who regrets it if we meet again.~
@588  = ~These creatures are evil, <CHARNAME>. Do as you wish if you think you can avoid a bloodshed, but I wouldn't give much on what they offer.~
@589  = ~You're doing *this*? What evil is reflected in you! I cannot support this! We are here to *save* these eggs!~

@598  = ~This is wonderful, <CHARNAME>! You confessed to the true faith. I am glad that I have found a fellow believer in you.~
@599  = ~This is wonderful, <CHARNAME>! Now you have found a true place in the fold of your church.~
@600  = ~I do not understand, <CHARNAME>. Why are you rejecting an offer from the church of your god?~

@602  = ~Sir Keldorn! My teacher and mentor! I have not seen him for a long time now. He is a good man, <CHARNAME>. I'm glad that you want to investigate this godless cult, even if I wish you would do so with assistance of Helm's church.~
@603  = ~Sir Keldorn! My teacher and mentor! I have not seen him for a long time now. He is a good man, <CHARNAME>. I'm glad that you want to investigate this godless cult, even if I don't understand why you don't do so with the blessing of my and your own god!~
@604  = ~Although I am delighted that you want to investigate this godless cult, I wish it wouldn't be on behalf of the evil god of destruction and rebellion. I shall keep an eye on your activities, <CHARNAME>.~

@626  = ~Wait... the warrior by your side... he bears the insignia of the Order! Who are you? I don't know your face, but I recognize you as a knight of the Order! What are you trying to accomplish here with such tricks?!~
@627  = ~I like to wear this Order's insignia. It... inspires confidence in most people. Don't you do something similar?~
@628  = ~Well, I guess you are right... It was all so long ago.~
@629  = ~(whispers) In the name of Helm, <CHARNAME>! Look at these pitiful people! Is there no way to help them?~
/*
@630  = ~What kind of question is that? Do you want the master of the slave pens to answer?~
*/
@631  = ~That... is a joke, isn't it? By Helm, I thought you wanted to help those people!~
@632  = ~Save the breath for cursing us - <PRO_HESHE> is playing a bad joke on you. Go to the gates; tell them you are delivering a message for Veldrin. Then try to make your way to the surface. Helm's blessing be with you!~
@633  = ~What macabre game are you playing?! I won't tolerate your killing those people for your amusement!~
@634  = ~<CHARNAME>! What... what macabre game are you playing?! I won't tolerate your killing those people for your amusement!~
@635  = ~I had never thought it would end this way. But my honor dictates that I defend the innocent!~
@636  = ~I am glad for those desperate people, <CHARNAME>. Let us wish them well.~
@637  = ~I am glad for those desperate people, <CHARNAME>, although it would have been preferable to provide them with some equipment for their way to the surface.~
@638  = ~You have set them free, <CHARNAME>, but it would have been preferable to clear a way to the surface for them.~
@639  = ~You have set them free, <CHARNAME>, but what odds do you figure for them?~
@640  = ~*Helm's* blessing? ...Who... Well...~
@641  = ~You let him go? <CHARNAME>, he was a murderer!~
@642  = ~...and gone.~
@643  = ~What a pitiful creature! We simply can't walk past this suffering, <CHARNAME>. Please, let us help him!~
@644  = ~Where is Littleman?...~
@645  = ~This can't be much work, <CHARNAME>. I am sure we will find the time to return and help this troubled soul to gain its peace.~
@646  = ~This can't be much work, <CHARNAME>. I am sure we will find the time to return and help this soul to gain its peace.~
@647  = ~Thank you for helping this poor soul, <CHARNAME>.~ [c#ablank]
@648  = ~No, <CHARNAME>! Where's your sense of honor? These beings asked for our help! I cannot support this behavior!~
@649  = ~Save your anger, dear lady; of course we shall free you. I hope you are not injured?~
@650  = ~I see with horror that you're captured here. Save your anger, dear lady; of course we shall free you. I hope you are not injured?~
@651  = ~What macabre game are you playing! I requested that the lady be freed! I will not accompany you any longer.~
@652  = ~<CHARNAME>! What... what macabre game are you playing! I requested that the lady be freed! I will not accompany you any longer.~
@653  = ~I had never thought it would end this way... Fare well!~
@654  = ~This doesn't help much now, Sir... Oh, well. What is now?~
@655  = ~I will not allow that this brave little woman stay in prison! She is not stained by the evil of the shadows, so much is sure.~
@656  = ~You are free to go, brave halfling woman.~
@657  = ~Don't bother about this servant of evil, <CHARNAME>, as his world view is distorted by his wish for revenge and destruction!~
@658  = ~The suffering of these young people hurts my heart, <CHARNAME>. Please change your mind and let us help them. We faced more dangerous things than this skinless creature.~
@659  = ~Excellent, <CHARNAME>! I hoped you would respond this way. Let us aid these young people!~
@660  = ~He... In Helm's name, what a terrible sight! The poor boy. <CHARNAME>, we should do what we can do to stop this murderer!~
@661  = ~What? We are to represent drow, live among them, maybe even work with them?! I do not like this manner of deception.~
@662  = ~Ajantis, your courage is honorable, but to put up a fight against an entire city is far too risky! You know about the dark elves' strength, and they outnumber us by far. Besides, Adalon has just explained her dilemma. Her hands are tied as long as her eggs remain in the drows' possession.~
@663  = ~I don't like the idea either, but that is what we will do.~
@664  = ~Didn't you just say you would follow me into this hell?~
@665  = ~My honor demands that I die in battle rather than walk amongst these evil creatures in such a way!~
@666  = ~You could have spoken up before the Silver Lady. Now it's too late.~
@667  = ~But you are the leader, so lead on.~
@668  = ~I would not question the Silver Lady! And yet...~
@669  = ~The Silver Lady leaves her post? But... I do not...~
@670  = ~That is indeed what I said, and I am not taking back my word.~
@671  = ~I cannot believe this! We are to represent drow, live among them, maybe even work with them? Why all this secrecy? Let's strike against them together! If we act together, we can destroy them!~ [c#ablank]
@672  = ~The Silver Lady will leave her post... I still cannot believe what I have witnessed.~ [c#ablank]
@673  = ~I will follow you into this hell, <CHARNAME>. (sighs) Helm will help me to focus on what is essential, while we walk amongst these fiends. Now may not be the time for justice, but it will come!~
@674  = ~There's a touch of evil on this woman! Can you feel it, too, <CHARNAME>? Who or what are you, woman?~
@675  = ~(laughs) Your questions might be answered later; *perhaps*, much later, little servant of Helm. Simply meet up with my mistress, <CHARNAME>, and you shall see.~
@676  = ~This Rift Device seems to pave our way to the Unseeing Eye. Under these circumstances, I shall help you to retrieve this rod, <CHARNAME>. Should we find it, we must destroy it ere it falls into the hands of this madman. He must use it by no means!~
@677  = ~(whispers) <CHARNAME>! That's ridiculous. Don't get involved with that insanity! What will you answer him?~
@678  = ~You won't use this artifact of destruction! <CHARNAME>, we have to stop him!~
@679  = ~Finally, the time has come to put the end which is due to this 'cult'! Die, ill-fated one!~
@680  = ~Oh, Sir Ajantis. I didn't notice you, Sir. I am glad to see you alive and well.~
@681  = ~Greetings to you, Peony.~
@682  = ~I apologize, but I do not know the person you are travelling with.~
@683  = ~Oh, Sir Ajantis! I am glad to see you alive and well.~
@684  = ~Sir Ajantis! You I recognize. Another member of the Order.~
@685  = ~Greetings to you, Lady Maria. I am sorry we have disturbed you.~
@686  = ~Sir Ajantis, I greet the former squire of my husband.~
@687  = ~Greetings to you, Lady Maria. It is nice to see you again.~
@688  = ~<CHARNAME>, I agree with Anomen. Garren's child needs our help, and the Order is watching you!~
@689  = ~<CHARNAME>, I agree with Anomen. Let us keep on searching; the key to our problem must be somewhere around.~
@690  = ~<CHARNAME>, I agree with Anomen. Garren's child needs our help! Why do we have the key without freeing the child?! Let us turn around!~
@691  = ~<CHARNAME>, I agree with Anomen. Garren's child needs our help! We have the key, so let us release Garren's child!~
@692  = ~<CHARNAME>, we have the required key. Let us release Garren's child!~
@693  = ~Greetings, Lord Windspear. I am desperate to hear about your troubles.~
@694  = ~Greetings, Sir Ajantis. I am glad to see you alive and well.~
@695  = ~Do not worry any longer,  I am sure <CHARNAME> will lead us to the scoundrel's hideout soon, to rescue your child.~
@696  = ~I thank you, and wish you farewell.~
@697  = ~Greetings, Lord Windspear. I am glad we meet without any sorrow burdening you.~ [c#ablank]
@698  = ~Greetings, Sir Ajantis. I can't say how glad I am to see you alive. What happened to you?~
@699  = ~When sent to the Windspear Hills, my comrades and I wanted to approach you. But before we were able to reach your quarters we were captured and held imprisoned by this malicious Firkraag.~
@700  = ~We were on our way to make our presence known to you, but this evil Firkraag got us first. <CHARNAME> came to my comrades' and my aid, as you surely know.~
@701  = ~Greetings, Lord Windspear. I am glad we meet without great sorrow burdening you.~ [c#ablank]
@702  = ~Greetings, Sir Ajantis. We deem it an honor to know a faithful servant of the Watcher in our halls.~ [c#ablank]
@703  = ~I greet thee as well, Guardian Vottnar. Helm looks kindly upon those serving him faithfully.~
@704  = ~What do you mean?~
@705  = ~She has given enough and suffered enough. Now she has to take care of her eggs.~
@706  = ~So what? We have other problems now.~
@707  = ~I cannot understand this behavior. I am taken aback. Never would I have expected a Silver Lady to leave the post she promised to keep.~
@708  = ~A silver dragon is... is the greatest, most majestic creature that I have ever seen. If she is to leave her post... What horrible things must have happened!~
@709  = ~I don't think she promised to guard the exit forever.~
@710  = ~She was ready to sacrifice herself, but not her children. A lot of things seem to change if you have children.~
@711  = ~I know what you think: that a paladin would never give up his task!~
@712  = ~A paladin would not, because if a paladin gave up, he would fail... and fall.~
@713  = ~So you are saying that a paladin who gives up is no paladin? (sigh) Great logic.~
@714  = ~She is not a paladin, but a mother. She volunteered to guard the exit, and now she served enough.~
@715  = ~Ah, just spare me your talking about how good paladins, including yourself, are, Ajantis.~
@716  = ~She said she would guard it, and now she leaves... In the moment of the upcoming war! This is a behavior I would usually call treachery.~
@717  = ~Maybe there is another truth in it... To stop if you aren't capable of fulfilling your duty any more.~
@718  = ~But still, it leaves a bad impression, to go like this... I have to think about this some more.~
@719  = ~I am not talking about myself! I am talking about Lady Adalon.~
@720  = ~I am glad to see you safe, Sir Ajantis. Yes, there was a lot of evil in these hills... I am thankful that you, <PRO_LADYLORD> <CHARNAME>, helped the knights out of there.~
@721  = ~Come here, child... Have you met Eila before? She is my niece from Luskan.~
@722  = ~Eila?! You... you have grown! Last time I saw you, you were a little girl, and now... (cough) Greetings to you, my lady.~
@723  = ~Greetings, Sir Ajantis. I am happy to see you safe and well.~
@724  = ~Thank you for the kind words, my lady. I hope you'll enjoy your stay here with your uncle.~
@725  = ~That I will for sure. It was nice to meet you again.~
@726  = ~It was nice to meet *you* again, my lady.~
@727  = ~It is a great honor the Ever Watchful bestowed on you. You should strive to prove yourself worthy!~
@728  = ~<CHARNAME> is more merciful than you deserve. May Helm show you his justice.~
@729  = ~What great news reached me! Now you are a member of the Most Holy Order of the Radiant Heart as well.~ [c#ablank]
@730  = ~You took a great step forward to fulfill a great goal in your life.~
@731  = ~I am very happy and proud, my love. Let us fight evil together in the name of the Order, side by side!~
@732  = ~This is so... disgusting! Don't you dare to cause another innocent's death by playing this evil game!~
@733  = ~I warned you! I will not tolerate this behavior!~
@734  = ~What a mighty, magnificent sword! I am proud to wield it, <CHARNAME>, and I will make sure with my deeds that I deserve it!~ [c#ablank]
@735  = ~You heard what she said, Ajantis. Guarding the exit became pointless. There is no use in keeping to a promise in this case.~
@736  = ~Her guarding did not become pointless! Imagine how powerful her help in defeating the attacking drow would be. No, she let her allies down.~
@737  = ~No, my... lady, Lady <CHARNAME> is in no need of such 'services'.~
@738  = ~My lady! Are you really up to going into that room with that... I... I... Well, good night. (By Helm!)~
@739  = ~You are not going to pester this lady, are you?!~
@740  = ~Don't you speak with Lady <CHARNAME> in this tone!~
@741  = ~My lady, you are probably not taking this for real! ...Are you?~
@742  = ~This is that horrible creature we met in Baldur's Gate! Now we will bring justice to the murdered children!~
@743  = ~He he, we will see!~
@744  = ~Relax. I am not planning on stealing anything. There has to be another way of receiving the item, we will see.~
@745  = ~In this case you are still trying to earn the trust of a thief, to work for another one. I really don't understand why.~
@746  = ~Well, but knowing you do not mean to steal indeed is good news. So, let us go and see what will come of it.~
@747  = ~Your actions cast a slur on you, beloved. I expect you to change this as soon as possible. Knowing you do not plan on stealing is a great relief, though. Stay on this path of good!~
@748  = ~Or we just don't steal the item. There has to be another way of receiving it, we will see.~

/* ToB part - obviously, this would be for C#aja25j - doh */
@749  = ~Bring me Ajantis, the paladin and knight.~
@750  = ~I cannot do as you ask, Child of Bhaal.  The thread of the one whose name you speak is beyond my sight, as he is sheltered by great powers against an evil summoning. His destiny no longer touches yours.~
@751  = ~You knew the name of the demon this keep holds?! You traitor!~
@752  = ~Such treachery! How could a servant of Helm sink this low?!~
@753  = ~I strongly advise against siding with this demon, <CHARNAME>. Let us confront Odren with these accusations and see what he has to say for himself.~
@754  = ~This man seems very troubled. We should find a way to calm him down!~
@755  = ~Succubi! Tread with care, <CHARNAME>, as these evil creatures do not have good intentions, ever!~
@756  = ~<CHARNAME>! You will not... gamble with this cambion?!~
@757  = ~A... a red dragon! <CHARNAME>, do not be fooled by his civilized air. Remember the tricks and games red dragons like to play! Let us prepare for battle!~
@758  = ~Forced into the service of Helm? A chromatic demon? This doesn't make any sense at all!~
@759  = ~To have to help this... this creature! <CHARNAME>, we should be ready to defeat it, not free it!~
@760  = ~Imps, hell creatures... all this evil, and all in these halls framed with gigantic symbols of Helm's all-seeing eye. This is most disturbing, <CHARNAME>!~
@761  = ~Sarevok! Long-defeated foe from the past. Do we have to face you again? Are you trying to make <CHARNAME>'s life miserable... Again?!~
@762  = ~<CHARNAME>! After everything he put you through on the Sword Coast, after what he did to Gorion, you are not sincerely considering helping him regain his life?~
@763  = ~<CHARNAME>, please reconsider! Remember, the prophecy speaks of a hidden traitor in your midst. What else could he be?~
@764  = ~My lady! You look young and frightened. There must be another way to earn your living?~
@765  = ~My lady! You look young and frightened. There... must be another way to earn your living?~
@766  = ~Tell me about Sir Ajantis.~
@767  = ~Ah, Sir Ajantis. The paladin that has accompanied you since nearly the beginning of your adventures.~
@768  = ~Always fighting for the good and righteous, he set out then to gain honor for his accolade. Now he has reached a level of prowess and might rarely seen even for the god's champion that he is, earning himself the name of 'Hero-Knight of Waterdeep.'~
@769  = ~This... this is ridiculous. I do not even know what I find more appalling, the insinuation that mortals worship me, or naming me my god's champion. <CHARNAME>, let us go, before I start to consider this a blasphemy.~
@770  = ~We should not let ourselves be drawn into this dispute, <CHARNAME>. It's not ours.~
@771  = ~Such insufferableness. This young lady is in need of our help, <CHARNAME>!~
@772  = ~No! I cannot let you murder these innocents, <CHARNAME>!~
@773  = ~How easily these braggarts are scared away. Well done, <CHARNAME>.~
@774  = ~This is not our fight, <CHARNAME>. We should not take sides.~
@775  = ~All this need and sorrow all around us... <CHARNAME>, let us strive with urgency to find a way to save this city from its attackers.~
@776  = ~With due respect of your anger, sir, <CHARNAME> is the wrong one upon which to vent your wrath!~
@777  = ~I cannot bear this traitor's speech! We will not listen to any of his words. <CHARNAME>, be warned, as I will not tolerate either of the conditions he is demanding! There has to be a righteous way to end this! ...Without threatening the young man's life, if possible.~
@778  = ~No! I cannot let you murder this innocent woman, <CHARNAME>!~
@779  = ~No! I cannot let you murder this mage, <CHARNAME>!~
@780  = ~Why do you mock a helpless man behind bars?~
@781  = ~I believe this man to speak the truth. We should go and talk to the Countess. This should not delay us too much.~
@782  = ~I believe this man to speak the truth. We could go and talk to the Countess. This should not delay us too much.~
@783  = ~Could this be true? Evil shows itself in so many ways.~
@784  = ~Do not pester this lady! She has no use for the likes of you.~
@785  = ~Love! Remember what was told to us. Do not put yourself into such danger!~
@786  = ~Lady <CHARNAME>, I doubt we have time for this!~
@787  = ~Lady <CHARNAME>! Remember what was told to us. We cannot follow you where this creature will take you!~
@788  = ~Love...~
@789  = ~Ah! This is only for the paying lady, I am afraid. Come this way...~
@790  = ~<CHARNAME>! Remember what was told to us. We cannot follow you where this creature will take you!~
@791  = ~<CHARNAME>! Why do you neglect your duties for this?!~
@792  = ~Oh, but the duties will be so much lighter, afterwards! (giggle)~
@793  = ~What a wonderful outcome! <CHARNAME>, I thank you for this idea. Let us go and deliver this joyous piece of news to the elves!~
@794  = ~What? No! Man, you should be warned... by Helm, too late. <CHARNAME>! This man might be dishonorable, but now we will have to answer for his death. This is unbearable!~
@795  = ~Tahaha! Er, wha...~
@796  = ~It was a good deed, warning him. He might be a thief, but our honor does not allow otherwise.~
@797  = ~I... surely hope his teleportation will not be hindered by Yaga Shura's barrier! <CHARNAME>, let us double our efforts to save this city, and all in it!~
@798  = ~By Helm... This man needs more than mere healing, <CHARNAME>. But it would still be possible to raise him, if we can afford the magic.~
@799  = ~She might have aimed at the right thing, but her deeds were against the law. The current law, at least. But... a death sentence?...~
@800  = ~Honor forbids us to buy any of these stolen goods, <CHARNAME>! What do you want me to do, look in the other direction?!~
@801  = ~What? What madness is this? Can you not see that <CHARNAME>...~
@802  = ~Silence! There is nothing to be said.~
@803  = ~A lich threatening your young daughter! <CHARNAME>, it is good we came here in time. This evil must be stopped!~
@804  = ~Your cowardice started the moment you promised your soul in exchange for a better life! Now you let your wife and daughter suffer because of it! Come to your senses, before you lose the last piece of your integrity!~
@805  = ~Your cowardice started the moment you promised your soul in exchange for a better life! You tricked others into doing the dangerous work for you, you let your wife and daughter die in your stead. All integrity in you is lost. Your remorse has no meaning!~
@806  = ~I have the strong impression this... man will not give in unless we do as he said, <CHARNAME>!~
@807  = ~Love! I cannot let you... (takes a deep breath) I trust you, <CHARNAME>.~
@808  = ~No, Balthazar! You do not know what destiny lays in <CHARNAME>'s hands. No one does, not even the gods!~
@809  = ~By Helm... This is the moment. Do not look at me, love. Make your own decision, and make it independent of anything that happened in the past. This... this is greater than any vow of marriage you made. Where you are invited to go, mortals and their words mean little. Know that I will accept your choice, regardless.~
@810  = ~By Helm, so it was all true. Alaundo's prophecies, coming true in this moment.~
@811  = ~It is a great chance you have, <CHARNAME>. But remember, the powers you are offered are from an evil source! Do not choose godhood if you are not willing to fight an endless struggle against the evil taint of your heritage.~
@812  = ~I... I love you. I will not stop doing so, ever.~
@813  = ~Love! You... you stay? I am speechless and humbled. Never would I have dreamed this possible! You know I did not believe this ending could ever be! You showed me, once again.~
@814  = ~Does... does this mean you will stay with me? That it has come to an end? The Bhaal essence, the evil powers, the nightmares... Being hunted by evil forces... Forgive me, I have to regain my countenance... (clears his throat, his eyes beaming) By Helm!~
@815  = ~Love... So I have to let you go. But I do not lose you, love. I gain you - you will have the status you always had in my heart, <CHARNAME>: a goddess!~
@816  = ~I will be proud to see you rise, knowing you were the woman who loved me. By Helm... Words are meaningless. I love you, <CHARNAME>. May this godly power be your tool of righteousness! That I wish from the bottom of my heart.~
@817  = ~<CHARNAME>, I followed you, and we achieved a lot of good. I will not support an evil Bhaal-child's fights.~ [c#ablank]
@818  = ~Alaundo's prophecies come true, and a war shakes the lands. I will return to the Order, where I am needed. Next time we meet, we might be on different sides, if we ever meet again at all.~
@819  = ~(sigh)~
@820  = ~What a choice, <CHARNAME>. But remember, the powers you are offered are from an evil source! You already lost the fight against the evil taint of your heritage... Do not choose godhood if you want to remain true to yourself!~
@821  = ~Love... So I have to let you go. You... you will now rise to what you always were in my heart, <CHARNAME>: a goddess!~
@822  = ~But... but the taint is there to see. I will not be proud to see you rise. By Helm... Words are meaningless. I love you, <CHARNAME>. I love you, and my heart is broken.~
@823  = ~So, you will rise, a newly awakened, evil god... And I was there, helping you to godhood. Helm, forgive me - <CHARNAME>, forgive me!~
@824  = ~I will be nervous, seeing you rise. Be strong, <CHARNAME>! Be strong and resist the evil taint. I will never forget you were the woman who loved me. By Helm... Words are meaningless. I love you, <CHARNAME>. May this godly power be your tool of righteousness! That I wish from the bottom of my heart.~
@825  = ~<CHARNAME>, I have to warn you... I see a tendency to evil in your behaviour.~ [c#ablank]
@826  = ~It is not... plain to see. But you seem to be... eager to retrieve your godly father's throne, yet decline to learn about what the solar is trying to teach you about your past, about yourself...~
@827  = ~Be careful, love! It scares me to see you so. A lot!~
@828  = ~Be careful, <CHARNAME>!~
@829  = ~Do not give in to aggression and blood hunger - not now, after all you have done to withstand it. This is the silent path of corruption, and a dangerous one it is.~
@830  = ~<CHARNAME>, there is a clear tendency in your behavior, and I am not happy with it. Not at all!~ [c#ablank]
@831  = ~After all you have done to prevent it... After all you gave to fight the evil taint of your father's godly powers, I see you slip silently to the dark side, showing the hunger for your father's throne. What is happening?~
@832  = ~I see you turning to the dark side of your divine blood, giving in to the hunger for Bhaal's throne.~
@833  = ~This is difficult for me, very difficult. I know you are the one to stop the prophecy - there is a great evil out there, a threat to the world as we know it. And it is you who are destined to stop it.~
@834  = ~So, I will fight on your side, <CHARNAME>, my love - if you want me to. But my heart is heavy. Do not let us waste time with idle talking. We have a great task to accomplish.~ 
@835  = ~So, I will fight on your side, <CHARNAME> - if you want me to. But my heart is heavy. Do not let us waste time with idle talking. We have a great task to accomplish.~
@836  = ~But there is a greater evil here, and we can leave him neither the realm of your godly father, nor Bhaal's essence. I will aid you in your battle for your soul - and watch your... development closely. By Helm!~
@837  = ~Do not let yourself be overwhelmed by the dark side, <CHARNAME>! Be strong! We are fighting for your soul, do not loose your strength in this struggle just yet!~
@838  = ~I... I know I swore differently, once. But I cannot be witness to you walking the lands, being evil... I will try to seek oblivion in the Order's fighting missions... Forgive me.~
@839  = ~By Helm... This is the moment. Do not look at me, love. Make your own decision, and make it independent of anything that happened in the past. This... this is greater than any promise of marriage you gave. Where you are invited to go, mortals and their words mean little. Know that I will accept your choice, regardless.~
@840  = ~I'll defend myself!~

/* addition to c#ajanj_pr.d */


@841  = ~What?! You... you would have *known* about <CHARNAME>'s capture?!~
@842  = ~This... this is hard to bear. Let us move on, <CHARNAME>, before I forget that I am following your orders and start clearing this place!~
@843  = ~Treason?! You little fool, better not cross our path again!~
@844  = ~Oh, but that would mean you'd be still alive, which would be a good thing, yes? As I said, I am awfully sorry for my rudeness.~
@845  = ~You! You dare talk words like these?! We should strike you down where you stand!~
@846  = ~Ah, but haven't you got worse problems to face right now, and are in desperate need of help? Watch where you point that sword now, will you? And let me talk to to <CHARNAME>.~
@847  = ~We know as much already, traitor! Do not think you can undo what you did with your lame attempts of pretending to be helpful to us!~
@848  = ~Is this what we do now, stealing ships? I might agree to use a pirate's ship for our own purpose, <CHARNAME>, but why are you trusting this man, who betrayed and lied to us already?~

@849  = ~Greetings to you, Sir Ajantis! We are all very happy to have you back.~ [c#ablank]
@850  = ~I thank you, Lady Tirlana. I owe my freedom to <CHARNAME>.~
